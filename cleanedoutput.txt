Part I Harry James Potter- Evans-Verres and the Methods of Rationality CHAPTER ONE A DAY OF V ERY LOW PROBABILIT Y Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line… (black robes, falling) …blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word. Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn’t enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows. This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs Petunia Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr H. Potter in emerald- green ink. The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other, but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be uncivilised. “You’re joking,” Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated that he was very much afraid that she was serious. “My sister was a witch,” Petunia repeated. She looked frightened, but stood her ground. “Her husband was a wizard.” “This is absurd!” Michael said sharply. “They were at our wedding— they visited for Christmas—” “I told them you weren’t to know,” Petunia whispered. “But it’s true. I’ve seen things—” The Professor rolled his eyes. “Dear, I understand that you’re not fa- miliar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible. Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they could always guess what you were thinking, that’s called cold reading—” “It wasn’t bending spoons—” “What was it, then?” Petunia bit her lip. “I can’t just tell you. You’ll think I’m—” She swal- lowed. “Listen. Michael. I wasn’t—always like this—” She gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. “Lily did this. Because I— because I begged her. For years, I begged her. Lily had always been prettier than me, and I’d…been mean to her, because of that, and then she got magic, can you imagine how I felt? And I begged her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too, even if I couldn’t have her magic, at least I could be pretty.” Tears were gathering in Petunia’s eyes. “And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to—the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children, and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to myself, what kind of parent names their child Dudley Dursley? It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out in front of me, and I couldn’t stand it. And I wrote to my sister and told her that if she didn’t help me I’d rather just—” Petunia stopped. “Anyway,” Petunia said, her voice small, “she gave in. She told me it was dangerous, and I said I didn’t care any more, and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and…I was beautiful, people were nice to me,” her voice broke, “and after that I couldn’t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end—” “Darling,” Michael said gently, “you got sick, you gained some weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own. Or being sick made you change your diet—” “She was a witch,” Petunia repeated. “I saw it.” “Petunia,” Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his voice. “You know that can’t be true. Do I really have to explain why?” Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears. “My love, I know I can’t win arguments with you, but please, you have to trust me on this—” “Dad! Mum!” The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they’d forgot- ten there was a third person in the room. Harry took a deep breath. “Mum, your parents didn’t have magic, did they?” “No,” Petunia said, looking puzzled. “Then no-one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter. How did they get convinced?” “Ah…” Petunia said. “They didn’t just send a letter. They sent a professor from Hogwarts. He—” Petunia’s eyes flicked to Michael. “He showed us some magic.” “Then you don’t have to fight over this,” Harry said firmly. Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would listen to him. “If it’s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it’s true. And if not, then Mum will ad- mit that it’s false. That’s what the experimental method is for, so that we don’t have to resolve things just by arguing.” The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual. “Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought you’d know better than to take this seriously, son, even if you’re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing there is!” Harry’s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had been sent to the best primary schools—and when that didn’t work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. Al- ways Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that’s what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a ten-year-old seriously? Hardly. Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father. “Mum,” Harry said. “If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There’s a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation—that you just have to look at the world and report what you see. Um…off the top of my head I can’t think of where to find something about how it’s an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments—” His mother looked down at him and smiled. “Thank you, Harry. But—” her head rose back up to stare at her husband. “I don’t want to win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once—” Harry closed his eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both of his parents were just hopeless. Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid. “I’m going to go to my room,” Harry announced. His voice trembled a little. “Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we’ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?” “Of course, Harry,” said his father, and his mother gave him a reassur- ing kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom. He shut the door behind him and tried to think. The funny thing was, he should have agreed with Dad. No-one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse. It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A little in- sanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working like that. Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. Don’t believe everything you think, one of his books had said. But this bizarre certainty…Harry was finding himself just expecting that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification—wasn’t making excuses in advance for why there wouldn’t be a professor, or the professor would only be able to bend spoons. Where do you come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed the thought at his brain. Why do I believe what I believe? Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in this particular case, he had no clue what his brain was thinking. Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it. He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started writing. Dear Deputy Headmistress Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another, tap- ping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil. This called for careful calligraphy. Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall, Or Whomsoever It May Concern: I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts, ad- dressed to Mr H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic parents, James Potter and L ily Potter (formerly L ily Evans) are dead. I was adopted by L ily’s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her husband, Michael Verres-Evans. I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she knows about magic, and she can’t use it herself. My father is highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don’t know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter. Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to L ily Potter (then L ily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real, and, I presume, help L ily obtain her school materials. If you could do this for my own family it w ould be extremely helpful. Sincerely, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, into which, using a penknife’s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style. Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his father’s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn’t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments could be, not arguing was somehow much worse. “Mum,” Harry said into the unnerving silence, “I’m going to test the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?” His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking shocked. “I—I don’t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.” That should’ve sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there’s no way to test your theory then, but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further. “Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave it around outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?” His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of course, Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis, or even watch it being tested, that would feel like associating himself with that… Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, did it occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it. But—well—that can’t really happen, can it? No matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I’m going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks. Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air. He swallowed. Calling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was…actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it. No. I’m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid. “Letter—” Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak. Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, “Letter for Hog- warts! Can I get an owl?” “Harry?” asked a bemused woman’s voice, one of the neighbours. Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope be- hind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame. An old woman’s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs Figg, the occasional babysitter. “What are you doing, Harry?” “Nothing,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “Just—testing a really silly theory—” “Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?” Harry froze in place. “Yes,” Harry’s lips said a little while later. “I got a letter from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but—” “But you don’t have an owl. Poor dear! I can’t imagine what someone must have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.” A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope. “Just leave it to me, dear,” said Mrs Figg, “and in a jiffy or two I’ll have someone over.” And her face disappeared from over the fence. There was a long silence in the garden. Then a boy’s voice said, calmly and quietly, “What.” CHAPTER TWO E V ERYTHING I BELIE V E IS FALSE Of course it was my fault. There’s no one else here who could be responsible for anything. “Now, just to be clear,” Harry said, “if the professor does levitate you, Dad, when you know you haven’t been attached to any wires, that’s going to be sufficient evidence. You’re not going to turn around and say that it’s a magician’s trick. That wouldn’t be fair play. If you feel that way, you should say so now, and we can figure out a different experiment instead.” Harry’s father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes. “Yes, Harry.” “And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be able to do this, and if that doesn’t happen, you’ll admit you’re mistaken. Nothing about how magic doesn’t work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.” Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a bemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and pointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish, which didn’t go together with the look at all. At first glance she looked like some- one who ought to cackle and put babies into cauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she opened her mouth. “Is that sufficient, Mr Potter?” she said. “Shall I go ahead and demonstrate?” “Sufficient? Probably not,” Harry said. “But at least it will help. Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress.” “Just Professor will do,” said she, and then, “Wingardium Leviosa.” Harry looked at his father. “Huh,” Harry said. His father looked back at him. “Huh,” his father echoed. Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall. “All right, you can put me down now.” His father was lowered carefully to the ground. Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just that strange part of him which had already been convinced, but…“That’s a bit of an anticlimax,” Harry said. “You’d think there’d be some kind of more dramatic mental event associated with updating on an observation of in- finitesimal probability—” Harry stopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were giving him that look again. “I mean, with finding out that everything I believe is false.” Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to have been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the universe, none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his brain just seemed to be going, All right, I saw the Hogwarts Professor wave her wand and make your father rise into the air, now what? The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite amused. “Would you like a further demonstration, Mr Potter?” “You don’t have to,” Harry said. “We’ve performed a definitive ex- periment. But…” Harry hesitated. He couldn’t help himself. Actually, under the circumstances, he shouldn’t be helping himself. It was right and proper to be curious. “What else can you do?” Professor McGonagall turned into a cat. Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, back-pedalling so fast that he tripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom with a thwack. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced. At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman. “I’m sorry, Mr Potter,” said the witch, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. “I should have warned you.” Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. “You can’t do that!” “It’s only a Transfiguration,” said Professor McGonagall. “An Anima- gus transformation, to be exact.” “You turned into a cat! A small cat! You violated Conservation of En- ergy! That’s not just an arbitrary rule, it’s implied by the form of the quan- tum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are complicated! A human mind can’t just visualise a whole cat’s anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?” Professor McGonagall’s lips were twitching harder now. “Magic.” “Magic isn’t enough to do that! You’d have to be a god!” Professor McGonagall blinked. “That’s the first time I’ve ever been called that.” A blur was coming over Harry’s vision, as his brain started to com- prehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified universe with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been flushed down the toilet; the whole notion of physics. Three thousand years of resolving big complicated things into smaller pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the same tune as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were perfectly universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took the form of simple maths governing the smallest parts, not to mention that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons, a brain was what a person was— And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that. A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry’s lips and the win- ner poured out: “And, and what kind of incantation is Wingardium Leviosa? Who invents the words to these spells, nursery schoolers?” “That will do, Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall said crisply, though her eyes shone with suppressed amusement. “If you wish to learn about magic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that you can go to Hog- warts.” “Right,” Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts together. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that was all; they still had the experimental method and that was the important thing. “How do I get to Hogwarts, then?” A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted from her by tweezers. “Hold on a moment, Harry,” his father said. “Remember why you haven’t been going to school up until now? What about your condition?” Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. “His condition? What’s this?” “I don’t sleep right,” Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. “My sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours later, every day. I can’t fall asleep any earlier than that, and then the next day I go to sleep two hours later than that. 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 2 a.m., 4 a.m., until it goes around the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no difference and I’m a wreck that whole day. That’s why I haven’t been going to a normal school up until now.” “One of the reasons,” said his mother. Harry shot her a glare. McGonagall gave a long hmmmmm. “I can’t recall hearing about such a condition before…” she said slowly. “I’ll check with Madam Pomfrey to see if she knows any remedies.” Then her face brightened. “No, I’m sure this won’t be a problem—I’ll find a solution in time. Now,” and her gaze sharpened again, “what are these other reasons?” Harry sent his parents a glare. “I am a conscientious objector to child conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer for a disintegrat- ing school system’s failure to provide teachers or study materials of even minimally adequate quality.” Both of Harry’s parents howled with laughter at that, like they thought it was all a big joke. “Oh,” said Harry’s father, eyes bright, “is that why you bit a maths teacher in third year.” “She didn’t know what a logarithm was!” “Of course,” seconded Harry’s mother. “Biting her was a very mature response to that.” Harry’s father nodded. “A well-considered policy for addressing the problem of teachers who don’t understand logarithms.” “I was seven years old! How long are you going to keep on bringing that up?” “I know,” said his mother sympathetically, “you bite one maths teacher and they never let you forget it, do they?” Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. “There! You see what I have to deal with?” “Excuse me,” said Petunia, and fled through the back door into the garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly audible. “There, ah, there,” Professor McGonagall seemed to be having trouble speaking for some reason, “there is to be no biting of teachers at Hog- warts, is that quite clear, Mr Potter?” Harry scowled at her. “Fine, I won’t bite anyone who doesn’t bite me first.” Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room briefly upon hearing that. “Well,” Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry’s parents had com- posed themselves and returned. “Well. I think, under the circumstances, that I should avoid taking you to purchase your study materials until a day or two before school begins.” “What? Why? The other children already know magic, don’t they? I have to start catching up right away!” “Rest assured, Mr Potter,” replied Professor McGonagall, “Hogwarts is quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect, Mr Potter, that if I leave you alone for two months with your schoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return to this house only to find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what remains of England.” Harry’s mother and father nodded in perfect unison. “Mum! Dad!” CHAPTER THREE COMPARING REALIT Y TO ITS ALTERNATI V ES But then the question is—who? “Good Lord,” said the barman, peering at Harry, “is this—can this be—?” Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he could, though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his eyebrows. A ques- tion like that deserved his very best. “Am I—could I be—maybe—you never know—if I’m not—but then the question is—who?” “Bless my soul,” whispered the old barman. “Harry Potter…what an honour.” Harry blinked, then rallied. “Well, yes, you’re quite perceptive; most people don’t realise that so quickly—” “That’s enough,” Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened on Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t pester the boy, Tom, he’s new to all this.” “But it is him?” quavered an old woman. “It’s Harry Potter?” With a scraping sound, she got up from her chair. “Doris—” McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around the room should have been enough to intimidate anyone. “I only want to shake his hand,” the woman whispered. She bent low and stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused and more uncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully shook. Tears fell from the woman’s eyes onto their clasped hands. “My grandson was an Auror,” she whispered to him. “Died in seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you.” “You’re welcome,” Harry said automatically, and then he turned his head and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading look. Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general rush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new referent for the phrase “Crack of Doom”, and everyone froze in place. “We’re in a hurry,” Professor McGonagall said in a voice that sounded perfectly, utterly normal. They left the bar without any trouble. “Professor?” Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had meant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an en- tirely different question instead. “Who was that pale man, by the corner? The man with the twitching eye?” “Hm?” said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised; perhaps she hadn’t expected that question either. “That was Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He’ll be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts this year at Hog- warts.” “I had the strangest feeling that I knew him…” Harry rubbed his fore- head. “And that I shouldn’t shake his hand.” Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong…that wasn’t really it at all, but Harry couldn’t find words. “And what was…all of that?” Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. “Mr Potter…do you know…how much have you been told…about how your parents died?” Harry returned a steady look. “My parents are alive and well, and they always refused to talk about how my genetic parents died. From which I infer that it wasn’t good.” “An admirable loyalty,” said Professor McGonagall. Her voice went low. “Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that. Lily and James were friends of mine.” Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said in a small voice. “But I have a Mum and Dad. And I know that I’d just make myself unhappy by comparing that reality to…something perfect that I built up in my imagination.” “That is amazingly wise of you,” Professor McGonagall said quietly. “But your genetic parents died very well indeed, protecting you.” Protecting me? Something strange clutched at Harry’s heart. “What…did happen?” Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry’s forehead, and his vision blurred for a moment. “Something of a disguise,” she said, “so that this doesn’t happen again, not until you’re ready.” Then her wand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick wall… …which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and shivered into a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with signs advertising cauldrons and dragon livers. Harry didn’t blink. It wasn’t like anyone was turning into a cat. And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding world. There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots (“Made with real Flub- ber!”) and “Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!” There were gog- gles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a line-up of comfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies. Harry’s head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind itself off his neck. It was like walking through the magical items section of an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook (he didn’t play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks). Harry desperately didn’t want to miss a single item for sale, in case it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of infinite wish spells. Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without think- ing, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading straight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal trim. He was brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall stepped right in front of him. “Mr Potter?” she said. Harry blinked, then realised what he’d just done. “I’m sorry! I forgot for a moment that I was with you instead of my family.” Harry gestured at the shop window, which displayed fiery letters that shone piercingly bright and yet remote, spelling out Bigbam’s Brilliant Books. “When you walk past a bookshop you haven’t visited before, you have to go in and look around. That’s the family rule.” “That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard.” “What?” “Nothing. Mr Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the bank of the wizarding world. Your genetic family vault is there, with the inheri- tance your genetic parents left you, and you’ll need money for school sup- plies.” She sighed. “And, I suppose, a certain amount of spending money for books could be excused as well. Though you might want to hold off for a time. Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the tower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more broad- ranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would probably be a duplicate.” Harry nodded, and they walked on. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great distraction,” Harry said as his head kept swivelling, “probably the best distraction anyone has ever tried on me, but don’t think I’ve forgotten about our pending discussion.” Professor McGonagall sighed. “Your parents—or your mother at any rate—may have been very wise not to tell you.” “So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There is a cer- tain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall.” “I suppose it would be rather pointless,” the witch said tightly, “when anyone on the street could tell you the story. Very well.” And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord, Voldemort. “Voldemort?” Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn’t. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who. The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apa- thetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror. (The bystander effect, thought Harry, thinking of Latané and Darley’s ex- periment which had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.) The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord’s wake and in his van- guard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and weaken. The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but they were terrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters wielded more than wands; there was wealth within those masked ranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail, to paralyse a society trying to protect itself. An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for increased taxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for the many to cower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had been found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning, next to the skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone wished for something more to be done, and no- one dared take the lead to propose it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example. Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that list. And those two might have died with their wands in their hands and not regretted their choices, for they were heroes; but for that they had an infant child, their son, Harry Potter. Tears were coming into Harry’s eyes. He wiped them away in anger or maybe desperation, I didn’t know those people, not really, they aren’t my parents now, it would be pointless to feel so sad for them— When Harry was done sobbing into the witch’s robes, he looked up, and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor McGonagall’s eyes as well. “So what happened?” Harry said, his voice trembling. “The Dark Lord came to Godric’s Hollow,” Professor McGonagall said in a whisper. “You should have been hidden, but you were betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt hulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of the terror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people want to see the scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake your hand.” The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up all his tears; he could not cry again, he was done. (And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of con- fusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it should have been a part of Harry’s art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.) Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall’s side. “I’ll—have to think about this,” he said, trying to keep his voice under control. He stared at his shoes. “Um. You can go ahead and call them my parents, if you want, you don’t have to say ‘genetic parents’ or anything. I guess there’s no reason I can’t have two mothers and two fathers.” There was no sound from Professor McGonagall. And they walked together in silence, until they came before a great white building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above saying Gringotts Bank. CHAPTER FOUR THE EFFICIE NT MARKET H YPOTHESIS World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimisation. Heaps of gold Galleons. Stacks of silver Sickles. Piles of bronze Knuts. Harry stood there, and stared with his mouth open at the family vault. He had so many questions he didn’t know where to start. From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagall watched him, seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her eyes intent. Well, that made sense. Being plopped in front of a giant heap of gold coins was a test of character so pure it was archetypal. “Are these coins the pure metal?” Harry said finally. “What?” hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near the door. “Are you questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr Potter-Evans-Verres?” “No,” said Harry absently, “not at all, sorry if that came out wrong, sir. I just have no idea at all how your financial system works. I’m asking if Galleons in general are made of pure gold.” “Of course,” said Griphook. “And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly that thereby collects seigniorage?” “What?” said Professor McGonagall. Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. “Only a fool would trust any but goblin coin!” “In other words,” Harry said, “the coins aren’t supposed to be worth any more than the metal making them up?” Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked bemused. “I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I get a ton of Sickles made from it?” “For a fee, Mr Potter-Evans-Verres.” The goblin watched him with glit- tering eyes. “For a certain fee. Where would you find a ton of silver, I wonder?” “I was speaking hypothetically,” Harry said. For now, at any rate. “So… how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction of the whole weight?” Griphook’s eyes were intent. “I would have to consult my superiors…” “Give me a wild guess. I won’t hold Gringotts to it.” “A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the coining.” Harry nodded. “Thank you very much, Mr Griphook.” So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely decoupled from the Muggle economy, no-one here has ever heard of arbitrage. The larger Muggle economy had a fluctuating trading range of gold to silver, so every time the Muggle gold-to-silver ratio got more than 5% away from the weight of seventeen Sickles to one Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the wizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the exchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay 5%), change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle world, ex- change it for more silver than you started with, and repeat. Wasn’t the Muggle gold-to-silver ratio somewhere around fifty to one? Harry didn’t think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked like the silver coins were actually smaller than the gold coins. Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that literally stored your money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons, where you had to go in and take coins out of your vault whenever you wanted to spend money. The finer points of arbitraging away market inefficiencies might well be lost on them. He’d been tempted to make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial system… But the sad thing is, their way is probably better. On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own the whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this notion in case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free. Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault ought to suit his near-term requirements. Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with one hand and dumping them into the other. When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. “I think that will be more than enough to pay for your school supplies, Mr Potter.” “Hm?” Harry said, his mind elsewhere. “Hold on, I’m doing a Fermi calculation.” “A what?” said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat alarmed. “It’s a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of get- ting rough numbers quickly in your head…” Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds…The mounds of gold coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds ster- ling. Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was too bad that he was right in the middle of discovering the amazing new world of magic, and couldn’t take time out to explore the amazing new world of being rich, which a quick Fermi estimate said was roughly a billion times less interesting. Still, that’s the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy pound. Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. “Pardon me for asking, Professor McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were in their twenties when they died. Is this a usual amount of money for a young cou- ple to have in their vault, in the wizarding world?” If it was, a cup of tea probably cost five thousand pounds. Rule one of economics: you can’t eat money. Professor McGonagall shook her head. “Your father was the last heir of an old family, Mr Potter. It’s also possible…” The witch hesitated. “Some of this money may be from bounties placed on You-Know-Who, payable to his ki—ah, to whoever might defeat him. Or those bounties might not have been collected yet. I am not sure.” “Interesting…” Harry said slowly. “So some of this really is, in a sense, mine. That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if I don’t remember the occasion.” Harry’s fingers tapped against his trouser-leg. “That makes me feel less guilty about spending a very tiny fraction of it! Don’t panic, Professor McGonagall!” “Mr Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be allowed to make reasonable withdrawals from—” “I am all about reasonable! I am totally on board with fiscal prudence and impulse control! But I did see some things on the way here which would constitute sensible, grown-up purchases…” Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a silent staring contest. “Like what?” Professor McGonagall said finally. “Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?” Professor McGonagall’s face grew stern. “Those are very expensive, Mr Potter!” “Yes, but—” Harry pleaded. “I’m sure that when I’m an adult I’ll want one. And I can afford one. Logically, it would make just as much sense to buy it now instead of later, and get the use of it right away. It’s the same money either way, right? I mean, I would want a good one, with lots of room inside, good enough that I wouldn’t have to just get a better one later…” Harry trailed off hopefully. Professor McGonagall’s gaze didn’t waver. “And just what would you keep in a trunk like that, Mr Potter—” “Books.” “Of course,” sighed Professor McGonagall. “You should have told me much earlier that sort of magic item existed! And that I could afford one! Now my father and I are going to have to spend the next two days frantically hitting up all the second-hand book- shops for old textbooks, so I can have a decent science library with me at Hogwarts—and maybe a small science-fiction collection, if I can assem- ble something decent out of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I’ll make the deal a little sweeter for you, okay? Just let me buy—” “Mr Potter! You think you can bribe me?” “What? No! Not like that! I’m saying, Hogwarts can keep some of the books I bring, if you think that any of them would make good additions to the library. I’m going to be getting them cheap, and I just want to have them around somewhere or other. It’s okay to bribe people with books, right? That’s a—” “Family tradition.” “Yes, exactly.” Professor McGonagall’s body seemed to slump, the shoulders lower- ing within her black robes. “I cannot deny the sense of your words, though I much wish I could. I will allow you to withdraw an additional hundred Galleons, Mr Potter.” She sighed again. “I know that I shall regret this, and I am doing it anyway.” “That’s the spirit! And does a ‘mokeskin pouch’ do what I think it does?” “It can’t do as much as a trunk,” the witch said with visible reluctance, “but…a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and Undetectable Exten- sion Charm can hold a number of items until they are called forth by the one who emplaced them—” “Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the super belt pack of ultimate awesomeness! Batman’s utility belt of holding! Never mind my Swiss army knife, I could carry a whole tool set in there! Or books! I could have the top three books I was reading on me at all times, and just pull one out anywhere! I’ll never have to waste another minute of my life! What do you say, Professor McGonagall? It’s for the sake of children’s reading, the best of all possible causes.” “…I suppose you may add another ten Galleons.” Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect, possibly even outright admiration. “And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I think I can remember seeing one or two other things I might want to store in that pouch.” “Don’t push it, Mr Potter.” “But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely this is a happy day, when I discover all things wizarding for the first time! Why act the part of the grumpy grown-up when instead you could smile and remember your own innocent childhood, watching the look of delight upon my young face as I buy a few toys using an insignificant fraction of the wealth that I earned by defeating the most terrible wizard Britain has ever known, not that I’m accusing you of being ungrateful or anything, but still, what are a few toys compared to that?” “You,” growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look on her face so fearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and stepped back, knocking over a pile of gold coins with a great jingling noise and sprawling back- wards into a heap of money. Griphook sighed and put a palm over his face. “I would be doing a great service to wizarding Britain, Mr Potter, if I locked you in this vault and left you here.” And they left without any more trouble. CHAPTER FI V E THE FUNDAME NTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR It would’ve required a supernatural intervention for him to have your morality given his environment. The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say cute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical glove shop that was on an alleyway off a side street of Diagon Alley. Disappoint- ingly, the shopkeeper was not a wizened ancient crone; just a nervous- looking young woman wearing faded yellow robes. Right now she was holding out a Moke Super Pouch qx31, whose selling point was that it had a Widening Lip as well as an Undetectable Extension Charm: you could actually fit big things in it, though the total volume was still limited. Harry had insisted on coming here straight away, first thing—insisted as hard as he thought he could without making Professor McGonagall sus- picious. Harry had something he needed to put into the pouch as soon as possible. It wasn’t the bag of Galleons that Professor McGonagall had allowed him to withdraw from Gringotts. It was all the other Galleons that Harry had surreptitiously shoved into his pocket after falling into a heap of gold coins. That had been a real accident, but Harry was never one to discard an opportunity…though it’d really been more of a spur-of- the-moment thing. Ever since Harry had been awkwardly carrying the allowed bag of Galleons next to his trouser pocket, so that any jingling would seem to come from the right place. This still left the question of how he was actually going to get the other coins into the pouch without getting caught. The golden coins might have been his, but they were still stolen—self-stolen? Auto-thieved? Harry looked up from the Moke Super Pouch qx31 on the counter in front of him. “Can I try this for a bit? To make sure it works, um, reliably?” He widened his eyes in an expression of boyish, playful innocence. Sure enough, after ten repetitions of putting the coin-bag into the pouch, reaching in, whispering “bag of gold”, and taking it out, Profes- sor McGonagall took a step away and began examining some of the other items in the shop, and the shopkeeper turned her head to watch. Harry dropped the bag of gold into the mokeskin pouch with his left hand; his right hand came out of his pocket tightly holding some of the gold coins, reached into the mokeskin pouch, dropped the loose Galleons, and (with a whisper of “bag of gold”) retrieved the original bag. Then the bag went back into his left hand, to be dropped in again, and Harry’s right hand went back into his pocket… Professor McGonagall looked back at him once, but Harry managed to avoid freezing or flinching, and she didn’t seem to notice anything. Though you never did quite know, with the adults that had a sense of hu- mour. It took three iterations to get the job done, and Harry guessed he’d managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons from himself. Harry reached up, wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead, and exhaled. “I’d like this one, please.” Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice the price of a wizard’s wand, appar- ently) and one Moke Super Pouch qx31 heavier, Harry and Professor Mc- Gonagall pushed their way out of the door. The door formed a hand and waved goodbye to them as they left, extruding its arm in a way that made Harry feel a bit queasy. And then, unfortunately… “Are you really Harry Potter?” whispered the old man, one huge tear sliding down his cheek. “You wouldn’t lie about that, would you? Only I’d heard rumours that you didn’t really survive the Killing Curse and that’s why no-one ever heard from you again.” …it seemed that Professor McGonagall’s disguise spell was less than perfectly effective against more experienced magical practitioners. Professor McGonagall had laid a hand on Harry’s shoulder and yanked him into the nearest alleyway the moment she’d heard “Harry Potter?” The old man had followed, but at least it looked like no-one else had heard. Harry considered the question. Was he really Harry Potter? “I only know what other people have told me,” Harry said. “It’s not like I remem- ber being born.” His hand brushed his forehead. “I’ve had this scar as long as I remember, and I’ve been told my name was Harry Potter as long as I remember. But,” Harry said thoughtfully, “if there’s already sufficient cause to postulate a conspiracy, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t just find another orphan and raise him to believe that he was Harry Potter—” Professor McGonagall drew her hand over her face in exasperation. “You look just about exactly like your father, James, the year he first at- tended Hogwarts. And I can attest on the basis of personality alone that you are related to the Scourge of Gryffindor.” “She could be in on it too,” Harry observed. “No,” quavered the old man. “She’s right. You have your mother’s eyes.” “Hmm,” Harry frowned. “I suppose you could be in on it too—” “Enough, Mr Potter.” The old man raised up a hand as if to touch Harry, but then let it fall. “I’m just glad that you’re alive,” he murmured. “Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank you for what you did…I’ll leave you alone now.” And his cane slowly tapped away, out the alley and down the main street of Diagon Alley. The Professor looked around, her expression tense and grim. Harry automatically looked around himself. But the alley seemed empty of all but old leaves, and from the mouth leading out into Diagon Alley, only swiftly striding passers-by could be seen. Finally Professor McGonagall seemed to relax. “That was not well done,” she said in a low voice. “I know you’re not used to this, Mr Potter, but people do care about you. Please be kind to them.” Harry looked down at his shoes. “They shouldn’t,” he said with a tinge of bitterness. “Care about me, I mean.” “You saved them from You-Know-Who,” said Professor McGonagall. “How should they not care?” Harry looked up at the witch-lady’s strict expression beneath her pointed hat, and sighed. “I suppose there’s no chance that if I said fundamental attribution error you’d have any idea what that meant.” “No,” said the Professor in her precise Scottish accent, “but please ex- plain, Mr Potter, if you would be so kind.” “Well…” Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that partic- ular bit of Muggle science. “Suppose you come into work and see your colleague kicking his desk. You think, ‘what an angry person he must be’. Your colleague is thinking about how someone bumped him into a wall on the way to work and then shouted at him. Anyone would be angry at that, he thinks. When we look at others we see personality traits that ex- plain their behaviour, but when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our behaviour. People’s stories make internal sense to them, from the inside, but we don’t see people’s histories trailing behind them in the air. We only see them in one situation, and we don’t see what they would be like in a different situation. So the fundamental attribution er- ror is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context.” There were some elegant experi- ments which confirmed this, but Harry wasn’t about to go into them. The witch’s eyebrows drew up beneath her hat’s brim. “I think I under- stand…” Professor McGonagall said slowly. “But what does that have to do with you?” Harry kicked the brick wall of the alley hard enough to make his foot hurt. “People think that I saved them from You-Know-Who because I’m some kind of great warrior of the Light.” “The one with power to vanquish the Dark Lord…” murmured the witch, a strange irony leavening her voice. “Yes,” Harry said, annoyance and frustration warring in him, “like I destroyed the Dark Lord because I have some kind of permanent, endur- ing destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I was fifteen months old at the time! I don’t know what happened, but I would suppose it had something to do with, as the saying goes, contingent environmental circumstances. And certainly nothing to do with my personality. People don’t care about me, they aren’t even paying attention to me, they want to shake hands with a bad explanation.” Harry paused, and looked at McGonagall. “Do you know what really happened?” “I have formed an idea…” said Professor McGonagall. “After meeting you, that is.” “Yes?” “You triumphed over the Dark Lord by being more awful than he was, and survived the Killing Curse by being more terrible than Death.” “Ha. Ha. Ha.” Harry kicked the wall again. Professor McGonagall chuckled. “Let’s get you to Madam Malkin’s next. I fear your Muggle clothing may be attracting attention.” They ran into two more well-wishers along the way. Madam Malkin’s Robes had a genuinely boring shop front, red or- dinary brick, and glass windows showing plain black robes within. Not robes that shone or changed or spun, or radiated strange rays that seemed to go right through your shirt and tickle you. Just plain black robes, that was all you could see through the window. The door was propped wide open, as if to advertise that there were no secrets here and nothing to hide. “I’m going to go off for a few minutes while you get fitted for your robes,” said Professor McGonagall. “Will you be all right with that, Mr Pot- ter?” Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping with a fiery passion and couldn’t blame the older witch for feeling the same way. Professor McGonagall’s wand came out of her sleeve, tapped Harry’s head lightly. “And as you’ll need to be clear to Madam Malkin’s senses, I am removing the Obfuscation.” “Uh…” Harry said. That did worry him a little; he still wasn’t used to the ‘Harry Potter’ thing. “I went to Hogwarts with Madam Malkin,” McGonagall said. “Even then, she was one of the most composed people I knew. She wouldn’t turn a hair if You-Know-Who himself walked into her shop.” McGonagall’s voice was reminiscent, and very approving. “Madam Malkin won’t bother you, and she won’t let anyone else bother you.” “Where are you going?” Harry inquired. “Just in case, you know, some- thing does happen.” McGonagall gave Harry a hard look. “I am going there,” she said, point- ing at a building across the street which showed the sign of a wooden keg, “and buying a drink, which I desperately need. You are to get fitted for your robes, nothing else. I will come back to check up on you shortly, and I expect to find Madam Malkin’s shop still standing and not in any way on fire.” Madam Malkin was a bustling old woman who didn’t say a word about Harry when she saw the scar on his forehead, and she shot a sharp look at an assistant when that girl seemed about to say something. Madam Malkin got out a set of animated, writhing bits of cloth that seemed to serve as tape measures and set to work examining the medium of her art. Next to Harry, a pale young boy with a pointed face and awesomecool blonde-white hair seemed to be going through the final stages of a similar process. One of Malkin’s two assistants was examining the white-haired boy and the chequerboard-gridded robe he was wearing; occasionally she would tap a corner of the robe with her wand, and the robe would loosen or tighten. “Hello,” said the boy. “Hogwarts, too?” Harry could predict where this conversation was about to go, and he decided in a split second of frustration that enough was enough. “Good heavens,” whispered Harry, “it couldn’t be.” He let his eyes widen. “Your…name, sir?” “Draco Malfoy,” said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled. “It is you! Draco Malfoy. I—I never thought I’d be so honoured, sir.” Harry wished he could make tears come out of his eyes. The others usually started crying at around this point. “Oh,” said Draco, sounding a little confused. Then his lips stretched in a smug smile. “It’s good to meet someone who knows his place.” One of the assistants, the one who’d seemed to recognise Harry, made a muffled choking sound. Harry burbled on. “I’m delighted to meet you, Mr Malfoy. Just unutter- ably delighted. And to be attending Hogwarts in your very year! It makes my heart swoon.” Oops. That last part might have sounded a little odd, like he was flirt- ing with Draco or something. “And I am pleased to learn that I shall be treated with the respect due to the family of Malfoy,” the other boy lobbed back, accompanied by a smile such as the highest of kings might bestow upon the least of his subjects, if that subject were honest, though poor. Eh…Damn, Harry was having trouble thinking up his next line. Well, everyone did want to shake the hand of Harry Potter, so—“When my clothes are fitted, sir, might you deign to shake my hand? I should wish nothing more to put the capper upon this day, nay, this month, indeed, my whole lifetime.” The white-blonde-haired boy glared in return. “And what have you done for the Malfoys that entitles you to such a favour?” Oh, I am so totally trying this routine on the next person who wants to shake my hand. Harry bowed his head. “No, no, sir, I understand. I’m sorry for asking. I should be honoured to clean your boots, rather.” “Indeed,” snapped the other boy. His stern face lightened somewhat. “Tell me, what House do you think you might be sorted into? I’m bound for Slytherin House, of course, like my father Lucius before me. And for you, I’d guess House Hufflepuff, or possibly House Elf.” Harry grinned sheepishly. “Professor McGonagall says that I’m the most Ravenclaw person she’s ever seen or heard tell of in legend, so much so that Rowena herself would tell me to get out more, whatever that means, and that I’ll undoubtedly end up in Ravenclaw House if the hat isn’t screaming too loudly for the rest of us to make out any words, end quote.” “Wow,” said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy gave a sort of wistful sigh. “Your flattery was great, or I thought so, anyway— you’d do well in Slytherin House, too. Usually it’s only my father who gets that sort of grovelling. I’m hoping the other Slytherins will suck up to me now I’m at Hogwarts…I guess this is a good sign, then.” Harry coughed. “Actually, sorry, I’ve got no idea who you are really.” “Oh come on!” the boy said with fierce disappointment. “Why’d you go and do that, then?” Draco’s eyes widened with sudden suspicion. “And how do you not know about the Malfoys? And what are those clothes you’re wearing? Are your parents Muggles?” “Two of my parents are dead,” Harry said. His heart twinged. When he put it that way—“My other two parents are Muggles, and they’re the ones that raised me.” “What?” said Draco. “Who are you?” “Harry Potter, pleased to meet you.” “Harry Potter?” gasped Draco. “The Harry—” and the boy cut off abruptly. There was a brief silence. Then, with bright enthusiasm, “Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? Gosh, I’ve always wanted to meet you!” Draco’s attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but kept on with her work, lifting Draco’s arms to carefully remove the chequered robe. “Shut up,” Harry suggested. “Can I have your autograph? No, wait, I want a picture with you first!” “Shutupshutupshutup.” “I’m just so delighted to meet you!” “Burst into flames and die.” “But you’re Harry Potter, the glorious saviour of the wizarding world! Everyone’s hero, Harry Potter! I’ve always wanted to be just like you when I grow up so I can—” Draco cut off the words in mid-sentence, his face freezing in absolute horror. Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant in black robes of the finest quality. One hand gripping a silver-handled cane which took on the character of a deadly weapon just by being in that hand. His eyes regarded the room with the dispassionate quality of an executioner, a man to whom killing was not painful, or even deliciously forbidden, but just a routine activity like breathing. That was the man who had, just that moment, strolled in through the open door. “Draco,” said the man, low and very angry, “what are you saying?” In one split second of sympathetic panic, Harry formulated a rescue plan. “Lucius Malfoy!” gasped Harry Potter. “The Lucius Malfoy?” One of Malkin’s assistants had to turn away and face the wall. Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. “Harry Potter.” “I am so, so honoured to meet you!” The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly threat. “Your son has been telling me all about you,” Harry gushed on, hardly even knowing what was coming out of his mouth but just talking as fast as possible. “But of course I knew about you before then, everyone knows about you, the great Lucius Malfoy! The most honoured laureate of all the House of Slytherin, I’ve been thinking about trying to get into Slytherin House myself just because I heard you were in it as a child—” “What are you saying, Mr Potter?” came a near-scream from outside the shop, and Professor McGonagall burst in a second later. There was such pure horror on her face that Harry’s mouth opened automatically, and then blocked on nothing-to-say. “Professor McGonagall!” cried Draco. “Is it really you? I’ve heard so much about you from my father, I’ve been thinking of trying to get Sorted into Gryffindor so I can—” “What?” bellowed Lucius Malfoy and Professor McGonagall in perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads swivelled to look at each other in duplicate motions, and then the two recoiled from one another as though performing a synchronised dance. There was a sudden flurry of action as Lucius seized Draco and dragged him out of the shop. And then there was silence. In Professor McGonagall’s left hand lay a small drinking-glass, tilted over to one side in the forgotten rush, now slowly dripping drops of alco- hol into the tiny puddle of red wine that had appeared on the floor. Professor McGonagall strode forward into the shop until she was op- posite Madam Malkin. “Madam Malkin,” said Professor McGonagall, her voice calm. “What has been happening here?” Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and then cracked up. She fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and that set off both of her assistants, one of whom fell to her hands and knees on the floor, giggling hysterically. Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her expression chilly. “I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes, Mr Potter, by the very clock.” “I was only joking around,” Harry protested, as the sounds of hysteri- cal laughter went on nearby. “Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted into Gryffin- dor! Joking around isn’t enough to do that!” Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking breaths. “What part of ‘get fitted for robes’ sounded to you like please cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!” “He was in a situational context where those actions made internal sense—” “No. Don’t explain. I don’t want to know what happened in here, ever. Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is contagious, and I don’t want to end up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam Malkin and her two poor assistants.” Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn’t in a mood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam Malkin, who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin’s two assistants, who had now both fallen to their knees, and finally down at his own tape-measure- draped body. “I’m not quite done being fitted for clothes,” Harry said kindly. “Why don’t you go back and have another drink?” CHAPTER SIX THE PLANNING FALLACY You think your day was surreal? Try mine. Some children would have waited until after their first trip to Diagon Alley. “Bag of element 79,” Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty, from the mokeskin pouch. Most children would have at least waited to get their wands first. “Bag of okane,” said Harry. The heavy bag of gold popped up into his hand. Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin pouch. He took out his hand, put it back in, and said, “Bag of tokens of economic exchange.” That time his hand came out empty. “Give me back the bag that I just put in.” Out came the bag of gold once more. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had got his hands on at least one magical item. Why wait? “Professor McGonagall,” Harry said to the bemused witch strolling be- side him, “can you give me two words, one word for gold, and one word for something else that isn’t money, in a language that I wouldn’t know? But don’t tell me which is which.” “Ahava and zahav,” said Professor McGonagall. “That’s Hebrew, and the other word means love.” “Thank you, Professor. Bag of ahava.” Empty. “Bag of zahav.” And it popped up into his hand. “Zahav is gold?” Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall nod- ded. Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only the most crude and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to support at least one conclusion: “Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn’t make any sense!” The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. “Problems, Mr Potter?” “I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know that ‘bag of 115 Galleons’ is okay but not ‘bag of 90 plus 25 Galleons’? It can count but it can’t add? It can understand nouns, but not some noun phrases that mean the same thing? The person who made this probably didn’t speak Japanese and I don’t speak any Hebrew, so it’s not using their knowledge, and it’s not using my knowledge—” Harry waved a hand helplessly. “The rules seem sorta consistent but they don’t mean anything! I’m not even going to ask how a pouch ends up with voice recognition and natural lan- guage understanding when the best Artificial Intelligence programmers can’t get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five years of hard work,” Harry gasped for breath, “but what is going on?” “Magic,” said Professor McGonagall. “That’s just a word! Even after you tell me that, I can’t make any new predictions! It’s exactly like saying ‘phlogiston’ or ‘élan vital’ or ‘emergence’ or ‘complexity’!” The black-robed witch laughed aloud. “But it is magic, Mr Potter.” Harry slumped over a little. “With respect, Professor McGonagall, I’m not quite sure you understand what I’m trying to do here.” “With respect, Mr Potter, I’m quite sure I don’t. Unless—this is just a guess, mind—you’re trying to take over the world?” “No! I mean yes—well, no!” “I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble answering the question.” Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial In- telligence in 1956. It had been the first conference ever on the topic, the one that had coined the phrase “Artificial Intelligence”. They had identi- fied key problems such as making computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves. They had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on these problems might be made by ten scientists working together for two months. No. Chin up. You’re just starting on the problem of unravelling all the secrets of magic. You don’t actually know whether it’s going to be too difficult to do in two months. “And you really haven’t heard of other wizards asking these sorts of questions or doing this sort of scientific experimenting?” Harry asked again. It just seemed so obvious to him. Then again, it’d taken more than two hundred years after the inven- tion of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists had thought to systematically investigate which sentences a human four-year-old could or couldn’t understand. The developmental psychology of linguistics could’ve been discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, but no-one had even thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn’t really blame the much smaller wizarding world for not investigating the Retrieval Charm. Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. “I’m still not sure what you mean by ‘scientific experimenting’, Mr Potter. As I said, I’ve seen Muggle-born students try to get Muggle science to work inside Hogwarts, and people invent new Charms and Potions every year.” Harry shook his head. “Technology isn’t the same thing as science at all. And trying lots of different ways to do something isn’t the same as experimenting to figure out the rules.” There were plenty of people who’d tried to invent flying machines by trying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright Brothers had built a wind tunnel to measure lift…“Um, how many Muggle-raised children do you get at Hogwarts every year?” “Perhaps ten or so?” Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet. “Ten?” The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting. If you were one in a million, there were seven of you in London and a thou- sand more in China. It was inevitable that the Muggle population would produce some eleven-year-olds who could do calculus—Harry knew he wasn’t the only one. He’d met other prodigies in mathematical competi- tions. In fact he’d been thoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally all day practising maths problems and who’d never read a science-fiction book and who would burn out completely before puberty and never amount to anything in their future lives because they’d just practised known techniques instead of learning to think creatively. (Harry was something of a sore loser.) But…in the wizarding world… Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who’d all ended their Muggle educations at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall might be bi- ased, but she had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest and most emi- nent wizarding school in the world…and it only educated up to the age of seventeen. Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how you went about turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally never heard of the scientific method. To her it was just Muggle magic. And she didn’t even seem curious about what secrets might be hiding behind the natural language understanding of the Retrieval Charm. That left two possibilities, really. Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and im- penetrable, that even though wizards and witches had tried their best to understand, they’d made little or no progress and eventually given up; and Harry would do no better. Or… Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made a quiet sort of clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off the walls of Diagon Alley. Possibility two: He’d be taking over the world. Eventually. Perhaps not right away. That sort of thing did sometimes take longer than two months. Muggle science hadn’t gone to the moon in the first week after Galileo. But Harry still couldn’t stop the huge smile that was stretching his cheeks so wide they were starting to hurt. Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting about how far ahead they’d been at age ten. But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either. There were probably a thou- sand people as intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history. Because those other geniuses hadn’t got their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness. They’d never found an important problem. You’re mine now, Harry thought at the walls of Diagon Alley, and all the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and customers; and all the lands and people of wizarding Britain, and all the wider wizarding world; and the entire greater universe of which Muggle scientists understood so much less than they believed. I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this territory in the name of Science. Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the cloudless skies. “What are you smiling about?” inquired Professor McGonagall, warily and wearily. “I’m wondering if there’s a spell to make lightning flash in the back- ground whenever I make an ominous resolution,” explained Harry. He was carefully memorising the exact words of his ominous resolution so that future history books would get it right. “I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something about this,” sighed Professor McGonagall. “Ignore it, it’ll go away. Ooh, shiny!” Harry put his thoughts of world conquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop with an open display, and Professor McGonagall followed. 47 CH APTER 6 48 THE PLANNING FALLACY 49 CH APTER 6 50 THE PLANNING FALLACY 51 CH APTER 6 52 THE PLANNING FALLACY 53 CH APTER 6 54 THE PLANNING FALLACY The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and unrecognis- able items still laid out on the slanted wooden display, the grey glow still protecting and the salesgirl back in her old position. The salesgirl looked up as they approached, her face showing surprise. “I’m sorry,” she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at almost the same moment, “I apologise for—” They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl laughed a little. “I didn’t mean to get you in trouble with Professor McGonagall,” she said. Her voice lowered conspiratorially. “I hope she wasn’t too awful to you.” “Della!” said Professor McGonagall, sounding scandalised. “Bag of gold,” Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up at the salesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. “Don’t worry, I understand that she’s only awful to me because she loves me.” He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor McGon- agall was spluttering something unimportant. “One Emergency Healing Pack Plus, please.” It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip swal- lowed the briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn’t help wondering what would happen if he tried climbing into the mokeskin pouch himself, given that only the person who put something in was supposed to be able to take it out again. When the pouch was done…eating…his hard-won purchase, Harry swore he heard a small burping sound afterwards. That had to have been spelled in on purpose. The alternative hypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate…in fact Harry couldn’t even think of any alternative hypothe- ses. Harry looked back up at the Professor, as they began walking through Diagon Alley once more. “Where to next?” Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it had been made from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur instead of paint. “Small pets are permitted at Hogwarts—you could get an owl to send let- ters, for example—” “Can I pay a Knut or something and rent an owl when I need to send mail?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “Then I think emphatically no.” Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point. “Might I ask why not?” “I had a pet rock once. It died.” “You don’t think you could take care of a pet?” “I could,” Harry said, “but I would end up obsessing all day long about whether I’d remembered to feed it that day or if it was slowly starving in its cage, wondering where its master was and why there wasn’t any food.” “That poor owl,” the older witch said in a soft voice. “Abandoned like that. I wonder what it would do.” “Well, I expect it’d get really hungry and start trying to claw its way out of the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably wouldn’t have much luck with that—” Harry stopped short. The witch went on, still in that soft voice. “And what would happen to it afterwards?” “Excuse me,” Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor McGon- agall by the hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet another alley- way; after ducking so many well-wishers the process had become almost unnoticeably routine. “Please cast that silencing spell.” “Quietus.” Harry’s voice was shaking. “That owl does not represent me, my par- ents never locked me in a cupboard and left me to starve, I do not have abandonment fears and I don’t like the trend of your thoughts, Professor Mc- Gonagall!” The witch looked down at him gravely. “And what thoughts would those be, Mr Potter?” “You think I was,” Harry was having trouble saying it, “I was abused?” “Were you?” “No!” Harry shouted. “No, I never was! Do you think I’m stupid? I know about the concept of child abuse, I know about inappropriate touching and all of that and if anything like that happened I would call the police! And re- port it to the head teacher! And look up social services in the phone book! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs Figg! But my parents never did anything like that, never ever ever! How dare you suggest such a thing!” The older witch gazed at him steadily. “It is my duty as Deputy Head- mistress to investigate possible signs of abuse in the children under my care.” Harry’s anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black fury. “Don’t you ever dare breathe a word of these, these insinuations to anyone else! No- one, do you hear me, McGonagall? An accusation like that can ruin people and destroy families even when the parents are completely innocent! I’ve read about it in the newspapers!” Harry’s voice was climbing to a high- pitched scream. “The system doesn’t know how to stop, it doesn’t believe the parents or the children when they say nothing happened! Don’t you dare threaten my family with that! I won’t let you destroy my home!” “Harry,” the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand to- wards him— Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked hers away. McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step backwards. “Harry, it’s all right,” she said. “I believe you.” “Do you,” Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through his blood. “Or are you just waiting to get away from me so you can file the papers?” “Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love you. You love them. I do believe you when you say that your parents are not abusing you. But I had to ask, because there is something strange at work here.” Harry stared at her coldly. “Like what?” “Harry, I’ve seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts, it would break your heart to know how many. And, when you’re happy, you don’t behave like one of those children, not at all. You smile at strangers, you hug people, I put my hand on your shoulder and you didn’t flinch. But sometimes, only sometimes, you say or do something that seems very much like…someone who spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving family that I saw.” Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her expression growing puzzled again. Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain away, as it dawned on him that he was being listened to respectfully, and that his family wasn’t in danger. “And how do you explain your observations, Professor McGonagall?” “I don’t know,” she said. “But it’s possible that something could have happened to you that you don’t remember.” Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what he’d read in the newspaper stories of shattered families. “Suppressed memory is a load of pseudo-science! People do not repress traumatic memories, they remember them all too well for the rest of their lives!” “No, Mr Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation.” Harry froze in place. “A spell that erases memories?” The older witch nodded. “But not all the effects of the experience, if you see what I’m saying, Mr Potter.” A chill went down Harry’s spine. That hypothesis…could not be easily refuted. “But my parents couldn’t do that!” “Indeed not,” said Professor McGonagall. “It would have taken some- one from the wizarding world. There’s…no way to be certain, I’m afraid.” Harry’s rationalist skills began to boot up again. “Professor McGon- agall, how sure are you of your observations, and what alternative expla- nations could there also be?” The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness. “Sure? I’m sure of nothing, Mr Potter. In all my life I’ve never met anyone else like you. Sometimes you just don’t seem eleven years old or even all that human.” Harry’s eyebrows rose toward the sky— “I’m sorry!” Professor McGonagall said quickly. “I’m very sorry, Mr Potter. I was trying to make a point and I’m afraid that came out sounding different from what I had in mind—” “On the contrary, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said, and slowly smiled. “I shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you mind if I offered an alternative explanation?” “Please do.” “Children aren’t meant to be too much smarter than their parents,” Harry said. “Or too much saner, maybe—my father could probably out- smart me if he was, you know, actually trying, instead of using his adult intelligence mainly to come up with new reasons not to change his mind—” Harry stopped. “I’m too smart, Professor. I’ve got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don’t respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they did, they wouldn’t sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I’m isolated, Professor McGonagall. I’ve been isolated my whole life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being locked in a cellar. And I’m too intelligent to look up to my parents the way that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they don’t feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like they’re the children—children who won’t listen and have absolute authority over my whole existence. I try not to be too bitter about it, but I also try to be honest with myself, so, yes, I’m bitter. And I also have an anger management problem, but I’m working on it. That’s all.” “That’s all?” Harry nodded firmly. “That’s all. Surely, Professor McGonagall, even in magical Britain, the normal explanation is always worth considering?” 59 CH APTER 6 60 THE PLANNING FALLACY 61 CH APTER 6 62 THE PLANNING FALLACY 63 CH APTER 6 64 THE PLANNING FALLACY The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop Harry had visited; the curtains were lush and delicately patterned, the floor and walls of stained and polished wood, and the trunks occupied places of hon- our on polished ivory platforms. The salesman was dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those of Lucius Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and Professor McGonagall. Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of heavy- looking wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with the pattern of a guardian dragon whose eyes shifted to look at anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be light, to shrink on command, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom and squirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four sides that each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the whole trunk. A lid with four locks each of which would reveal a different space inside. And—this was the important part—a handle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a staircase leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry estimated, around twelve bookcases. If they made luggage like this, Harry didn’t know why anyone both- ered owning a house. One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a good trunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the Galleon, that was enough to buy a second-hand car. It would be more expensive than everything else Harry had ever bought in his whole life all put together. Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of gold Harry had been allowed to take out of Gringotts. Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After a long day’s shopping she hadn’t needed to ask Harry how much gold was left in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that scientifically illiterate was not at all the same thing as stupid. “I’m sorry, young man,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is entirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will be closed for all but emergency services now.” Harry looked at her, wondering… “Well,” sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel, “we may as well go, I suppose.” …she hadn’t lost it completely when a child had dared defy her. She hadn’t been happy, but she had thought instead of exploding in fury. It might have just been that there was an immortal Dark Lord to fight—that she had needed Harry’s goodwill. But most adults wouldn’t have been ca- pable of thinking even that much; wouldn’t consider future consequences at all, if someone lower in status had refused to obey them… “Professor?” Harry said. The witch turned back and looked at him. Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what he wanted to try now, there was no way he’d have the courage to do it other- wise. She didn’t listen to me, he thought to himself, I would have taken more gold but she didn’t want to listen… Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke. “Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than enough for a trunk. That’s why you didn’t bother warning me before it went down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the research studies show—that’s what happens when people think they’re leaving themselves a little error margin. They’re not pessimistic enough. If it’d been up to me, I’d have taken two hundred Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But I thought you wouldn’t let me do it. I thought you’d be angry at me just for asking. Was I wrong?” “I suppose I must confess that you are right,” said Professor McGon- agall. “But, young man—” “That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting adults.” Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. “Because they get angry if you even try to reason with them. To them it’s defiance and insolence and a chal- lenge to their higher tribal status. If you try to talk to them they get angry. So if I had anything really important to do, I wouldn’t be able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to whatever I said—because that’s also part of the role of someone playing a concerned adult—you’d never change your actions, you wouldn’t actually behave differently, because of anything I said.” The salesman was watching them both with unabashed fascination. “I can understand your point of view,” Professor McGonagall said eventually. “If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I have served as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several thousand years.” Harry nodded and continued. “So—suppose I had a way to get more Galleons from my vault without us going back to Gringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient child. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you’d have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take advantage of it?” “What?” said Professor McGonagall. “To put it another way, if I could make today have happened differently, so that we didn’t take too little money with us, would that be all right even though it would involve a child being insolent to an adult in retrospect?” “I…suppose…” the witch said, looking quite puzzled. Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, “Eleven Galleons origi- nally from my family vault.” And there was gold in Harry’s hand. For a moment Professor McGonagall’s mouth gaped wide, then her jaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out, “Where did you get that—” “From my family vault, like I said.” “How?” “Magic.” “That’s hardly an answer!” snapped Professor McGonagall, and then stopped, blinking. “No, it isn’t, is it? I ought to claim that it’s because I experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the pouch works and that it can actu- ally retrieve objects from anywhere, not just its own inside, if you phrase the request correctly. But actually it’s from when I fell into that pile of gold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who un- derstands pessimism knows that money is something you might need quickly and without much warning. So now are you angry at me for defy- ing your authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important mission?” The salesman’s eyes were wide like saucers. And the tall witch stood there, silent. “Discipline at Hogwarts must be enforced,” she said after almost a full minute. “For the sake of all the students. And that must include courtesy and obedience from you to all professors.” “I understand, Professor McGonagall.” “Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home.” Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or something. That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on anyone. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something really serious that an adult needed from him, but still— Minerva McGonagall, +1 point. Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleons into McGonagall’s hands. “Thank you very much, Professor. Can you fin- ish up the purchase for me? I’ve got to visit the lavatory.” The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into the wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, he heard the salesman ask in his oily voice, “May I inquire as to who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin—third-year, perhaps?— and from a prominent family, but I did not recognise—” The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry had identified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the magical self-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture off his fore- head. Harry’s entire body was sheathed in sweat which had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it didn’t show through the robes. 69 CH APTER 6 70 THE PLANNING FALLACY Aftermath Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His twinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. “So, my dear, how did you find Harry?” Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she opened her mouth again. No words came out. “I see,” Albus said gravely. “Thank you for your report, Minerva. You may go.” CHAPTER SE V EN RECIPROCATION Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad. Petunia Evans-Verres’s lips were trembling and her eyes were tear- ing up as Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of King’s Cross Station. “Are you sure you don’t want me to come with you, Harry?” Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was look- ing stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his mother, who really did look rather…discomposed. “Mum, I know you don’t like the wiz- arding world very much. You don’t have to come with. I mean it.” Petunia winced. “Harry, you shouldn’t worry about me, I’m your mother and if you need someone with you—” “Mum, I’m going to be on my own at Hogwarts for months and months. If I can’t manage a train platform alone, better to find out sooner rather than later so we can abort.” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Besides, Mum, they all love me over there. If I have any problems, all I need to do is take off my sweatband,” Harry tapped the exercise band covering his scar, “and I’ll have way more help than I can handle.” “Oh, Harry,” Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged him hard, face to face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry could feel her ragged breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob escape. “Oh, Harry, I do love you, always remember that.” It’s like she’s afraid she’ll never see me again, the thought popped into Harry’s head. He knew the thought was true but he didn’t know why Mum was so afraid. So he made a guess. “Mum, you know that I’m not going to turn into your sister just because I’m learning magic, right? I’ll do any magic you ask for—if I can, I mean—or if you want me not to use any magic around the house, I’ll do that too, I promise I’ll never let magic come between us—” A tight hug cut off his words. “You have a good heart,” his mother whis- pered into his ear. “A very good heart, my son.” Harry choked up himself a little, then. His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchief out of her handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the running make- up around her eyes. There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the magical side of King’s Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking at Harry’s trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael Verres-Evans couldn’t even walk. So instead his father just cleared his throat. “Good luck at school, Harry,” he said. “Do you think I bought you enough books?” Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this might be his big chance to do something really revolutionary and important, and Professor Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his extremely busy schedule for two solid days in order to go on the Greatest Second-hand Bookshop Raid Ever, which had covered four cities and produced thirty boxes of science books now sitting in the cavern level of Harry’s trunk. Most of the books had gone for a pound or two, but some of them defi- nitely hadn’t, like the very latest Handbook of Chemistry and Physics or the complete 1972 set of the Encyclopædia Britannica. His father had tried to block Harry off from seeing the till displays but Harry figured his father must have spent at least a thousand pounds. Harry had said to his father that he would pay him back as soon as he figured out how to convert wiz- arding gold into Muggle money, and his father had told him to go boil his head. And then his father had asked him: Do you think I bought you enough books? It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to hear. Harry’s throat was hoarse, for some reason. “You can never have enough books,” he recited the Verres family motto, and his father knelt down and gave him a quick, firm embrace. “But you certainly tried,” Harry said, and felt himself choking up again. “It was a really, really, really good try.” His Dad straightened. “So…” he said. “Do you see a Platform Nine-and- Three-Quarters?” King’s Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors paved with ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary people hurrying about their ordinary business, having ordinary conversations which gen- erated lots and lots of ordinary noise. King’s Cross Station had a Platform Nine (which they were standing on) and a Platform Ten (right next to it) but there was nothing between Platform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin, unpromising barrier wall. A great skylight overhead let in plenty of light to illuminate the total lack whatsoever of any Platform Nine-and- Three-Quarters. Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, come on, mage- sight, come on, mage-sight, but absolutely nothing appeared to him. He thought about taking out his wand and waving it, but Professor McGon- agall had warned him against using his wand. Plus if there was another shower of multicoloured sparks that might lead to being arrested for set- ting off fireworks inside a train station. And that was assuming his wand didn’t decide to do something else, like blowing up all of King’s Cross. Harry had only lightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim was quite bizarre enough) in a very quick effort to determine what sort of science books to buy over the next 48 hours. Well, he had—Harry glanced at his watch—one whole hour to figure it out, since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven. Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn’t become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the second most important factor in schol- arly success.) “I’ll figure it out,” Harry said to his waiting parents. “It’s probably some sort of test thingy.” His father frowned. “Hm…maybe look for a trail of mixed footprints on the ground, leading somewhere that doesn’t seem to make sense—” “Dad!” Harry said. “Stop that! I haven’t even tried to figure it out on my own!” It was a very good suggestion, too, which was worse. “Sorry,” his father apologised. “Ah…” Harry’s mother said. “I don’t think they would do that to a stu- dent, do you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn’t tell you anything?” “Maybe she was distracted,” Harry said without thinking. “Harry!” hissed his father and mother in unison. “What did you do?” “I, um—” Harry swallowed. “Look, we don’t have time for this now—” “Harry!” “I mean it! We don’t have time for this now! Because it’s a really long story and I’ve got to figure out how to get to school!” His mother had a hand over her face. “How bad was it?” “I, ah,” I can’t talk about that for reasons of National Security, “about half as bad as the Incident with the Science Project?” “Harry!” “I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I’ll go ask them how to get in!” and Harry ran away from his parents towards the family of fiery redheads, his trunk automatically slithering behind him. The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. “Hello, dear. First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too—” and then she peered closely at him. “Harry Potter?” Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and then froze in place. “Oh, come on!” Harry protested. He’d been planning to go as Harry Verres at least until he got to Hogwarts. “I bought a sweatband and ev- erything! How come you know who I am?” “Yes,” Harry’s father said, coming up behind him with long easy strides, “how do you know who he is?” His voice indicated a certain dread. “Your picture was in the newspapers,” said one of two identical- looking twins. “Harry!” “Dad! It’s not like that! It’s ’cause I defeated the Dark Lord You-Know- Who when I was one year old!” “What?” “Mum can explain.” “What?” “Ah…Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would be best not to bother you with until now—” “Excuse me,” Harry said to the red-headed family who were all staring at him, “but it would be quite extremely helpful if you could tell me how to get to Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters right now.” “Ah…” said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the wall be- tween platforms. “Just walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very im- portant. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.” “And whatever you do, don’t think of an elephant.” “George! Ignore him, Harry dear, there’s no reason not to think of an elephant.” “I’m Fred, Mum, not George—” “Thanks!” Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier— Wait a minute, it wouldn’t work unless he believed in it? It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually work- ing fast enough to realise that this was a case where “resonant doubt” ap- plied, that is, if he’d started out thinking that he would go through the barrier he’d have been fine, only now he was worried about whether he sufficiently believed he’d go through the barrier, which meant that he ac- tually was worried about crashing into it— “Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to do!” That was his Dad. Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about justified credibility and just tried to believe really hard that he’d go through the bar- rier and— —the sounds around him changed. Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely dirtied by having made a deliberate effort to believe something. He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single huge train, fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive scarlet-metal steam engine with a tall chimney that promised death to air quality. The platform was already lightly crowded (even though Harry was a full hour early); dozens of children and their parents swarmed around benches, tables, and various hawkers and stalls. It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in King’s Cross Station and no room to hide it. Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else entirely (b) they can fold space like nobody’s business or (c) they are simply ignoring all the rules. There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned around to observe that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small clawed ten- tacles. Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had also managed to believe with sufficient strength to pass through the barrier. That was actually a little disturbing when Harry started thinking about it. A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came through the iron archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind him on a lead and nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid for having stayed around, quickly began moving away from the landing area, and the red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard on his trunk’s lead in order to keep up. A moment later, a white owl fluttered through the archway and came to rest on the boy’s shoulder. “Cor,” said the red-haired boy, “are you really Harry Potter?” Not this again. “I have no logical way of knowing that for certain. My parents raised me to believe that my name was Harry James Potter- Evans-Verres, and many people here have told me that I look like my par- ents, I mean my other parents, but,” Harry frowned, realising, “for all I know, there could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified appearance—” “Er, what, mate?” Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it. “Yes, I’m Harry Potter.” “I’m Ron Weasley,” said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid, and stuck out a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked. The owl gave Harry an oddly measured and courteous hoot (actually more of an eehh- hhh sound, which surprised Harry). At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent catastrophe. “Just a second,” he said to Ron, and opened one of the drawers of his trunk, the one that if he recalled correctly was for Winter Clothes—it was—and then he found the lightest scarf he owned, underneath his winter coat. Harry took off his sweatband, and just as quickly unfolded the scarf and tied it around his face. It was a little hot, especially in the summer, but Harry could live with that. Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drew forth black wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now that he was out of Muggle territory. “There,” Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through the scarf over his face. He turned to Ron. “How do I look? Stupid, I know, but am I identifiable as Harry Potter?” “Er,” Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. “Not really, Harry.” “Very good,” Harry said. “However, so as not to obviate the point of the whole exercise, you will henceforth address me as,” Verres might not work any more, “Mr Spoo.” “Okay, Harry,” Ron said uncertainly. The Force is not particularly strong in this one. “Call…me…Mister…Spoo.” “Okay, Mister Spoo—” Ron stopped. “I can’t do that, it makes me feel stupid.” That’s not just a feeling. “Okay. You pick a name.” “Mr Cannon,” Ron said at once. “For the Chudley Cannons.” “Ah…” Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this. “Who or what are the Chudley Cannons?” “Who’re the Chudley Cannons? Only the most brilliant team in the whole history of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the bottom of the league last year, but—” “What’s Quidditch?” Asking this was also a mistake. “So let me get this straight,” Harry said as it seemed that Ron’s expla- nation (with associated hand gestures) was winding down. “Catching the Snitch is worth one hundred and fifty points?” “Yeah—” “How many ten-point goals does one side usually score not counting the Snitch?” “Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games—” “That’s just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game design. Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make sense, sort of, for a sport I mean, but you’re basically saying that catching the Snitch over- whelms almost any ordinary point spread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for the Snitch and usually not interacting with any- one else, spotting the Snitch first is going to be mostly luck—” “It’s not luck!” protested Ron. “You’ve got to keep your eyes moving in the right pattern—” “That’s not interactive, there’s no back-and-forth with the other player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly good at moving their eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky swoops in and grabs the Snitch and makes everyone else’s work moot. It’s like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless extra position so that you could be the Most Important Player without needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who was the first Seeker, the King’s idiot son who wanted to play Quidditch but couldn’t understand the rules?” Actually, now that Harry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good hypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny thing… Ron’s face pulled into a scowl. “If you don’t like Quidditch, you don’t have to make fun of it!” “If you can’t criticise, you can’t optimise. I’m suggesting how to improve the game. And it’s very simple. Get rid of the Snitch.” “They won’t change the game just ’cause you say so!” “I am the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to me. And maybe if I can persuade them to change the game at Hogwarts, the in- novation will spread.” A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron’s face. “But, but if you get rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the game ends?” “Buy…a…clock. It would be a lot fairer than having the game sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not end for hours, and the sched- ule would be a lot more predictable for the spectators, too.” Harry sighed. “Oh, stop giving me that look of absolute horror, I probably won’t actually take the time to destroy this pathetic excuse for a national sport and re- make it stronger and smarter in my own image. I’ve got way, way, way more important stuff to worry about.” Harry looked thoughtful. “Then again, it wouldn’t take much time to write up the Ninety-Five Theses of the Snitchless Reformation and nail it to a church door—” “Potter,” drawled a young boy’s voice, “what is that on your face and what is standing next to you?” Ron’s look of horror was replaced by utter hatred. “You!” Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who might have been forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up for that with a trunk looking at least as magical and far more elegant than Harry’s own, decorated in silver and emeralds and bearing what Harry guessed to be the Malfoy family crest, a beautiful fanged serpent over crossed ivory wands. “Draco!” Harry said. “Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that kind of sounds like Lucius to me. I’m glad to see you’re doing so well after, um, our last meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I’m trying to go incognito, so call me, eh,” Harry looked down at his robes, “Mister Black.” “Harry!” hissed Ron. “You can’t use that name!” Harry blinked. “Why not?” It sounded nicely dark, like an international man of mystery— “I’d say it’s a fine name,” said Draco, “but it belongs to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. I’ll call you Mr Silver.” “You get away from…from Mr Gold,” Ron said coldly, and took a for- ward step. “He doesn’t need to talk to the likes of you!” Harry raised a placating hand. “I’ll go by Mr Bronze, thanks for the naming schema. And, Ron, um,” Harry struggled to find a way to say this, “I’m glad you’re so…enthusiastic about protecting me, but I don’t particu- larly mind talking to Draco—” This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry with eyes now aflame with outrage. “What? Do you know who this is?” “Yes, Ron,” Harry said, “you may remember that I called him Draco without him needing to introduce himself.” Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron’s shoul- der. “Oh, what’s this?” Draco said in a drawl rich with malice. “Where’s the famous Weasley family rat?” “Buried in the backyard,” Ron said coldly. “Aw, how sad. Pot…ah, Mr Bronze, I should mention that the Weasley family is widely agreed to have the best pet story ever. Want to tell it, Weasley?” Ron’s face contorted. “You wouldn’t think it was funny if it happened to your family!” “Oh,” Draco purred, “but it wouldn’t ever happen to the Malfoys.” Ron’s hands clenched into fists— “That’s enough,” Harry said, putting as much quiet authority into the voice as he could manage. It was clear that whatever this was about, it was a painful memory for the red-haired kid. “If Ron doesn’t want to talk about it, he doesn’t have to talk about it, and I’d ask that you not talk about it either.” Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. “That’s right, Harry! I mean Mr Bronze! You see what kind of person he is? Now tell him to go away!” Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very quick 12345678910—an odd habit left over from the age of five when his mother had first instructed him to do it, and Harry had reasoned that his way was faster and ought to be just as effective. “I’m not telling him to go away,” Harry said calmly. “He’s welcome to talk to me if he wants.” “Well, I don’t intend to hang around with anyone who hangs around with Draco Malfoy,” Ron announced coldly. Harry shrugged. “That’s up to you. I don’t intend to let anyone say who I can and can’t hang around with.” Silently chanting, please go away, please go away… Ron’s face went blank with surprise, like he’d actually expected that line to work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage’s lead and stormed off down the platform. “If you didn’t like him,” Draco said curiously, “why didn’t you just walk away?” “Um…his mother helped me figure out how to get to this platform from King’s Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to tell him to get lost. And it’s not that I hate this Ron guy,” Harry said, “I just, just…” Harry searched for words. “Don’t see any reason for him to exist?” offered Draco. “Pretty much.” “Anyway, Potter…if you really were raised by Muggles—” Draco paused here, as if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn’t say anything “—then you mightn’t know what it’s like to be famous. People want to take up all of our time. You have to learn to say no.” Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. “That sounds like good advice.” “If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time with the pushiest ones. Decide who you want to spend time with and make ev- eryone else leave. You’re just getting here, Potter, so everyone’s going to judge you by who they see you with, and you don’t want to be seen with the likes of Ron Weasley.” Harry nodded again. “If you don’t mind my asking, how did you recog- nise me?” “Mister Bronze,” Draco drawled, “I have met you, remember. I saw someone going around with a scarf wrapped around his head, looking absolutely ridiculous. So I took a guess.” Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. “I’m terribly sorry about that,” Harry said. “Our first meeting, I mean. I didn’t mean to em- barrass you in front of Lucius.” Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. “I just wish Father could have come in while you were flattering me—” Draco laughed. “But thank you for what you said to Father. If not for that, I might’ve had a harder time explaining.” Harry swept a deeper bow. “And thank you for reciprocating with what you said to Professor McGonagall.” “You’re welcome. Though one of the assistants must’ve sworn her clos- est friend to absolute secrecy, because Father says there’re weird rumours going around, like you and I got in a fight or something.” “Ouch,” Harry said, wincing. “I’m really sorry—” “No, we’re used to it, Merlin knows there’s lots of rumours about the Malfoy family already.” Harry nodded. “I’m glad to hear you’re not in trouble.” Draco smirked. “Father has, um, a refined sense of humour, but he does understand making friends. He understands it very well. He made me repeat that before I went to bed every night for the last month, ‘I will make friends at Hogwarts.’ When I explained everything to him and he saw that’s what I was doing, he bought me an ice-cream.” Harry’s jaw dropped. “You managed to spin that into an ice-cream?” Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved. “Well, father knew what I was doing, of course, but he’s the one who taught me how to do it, and if I grin the right way while I’m doing it, that makes it a father-son thing and then he has to buy me an ice-cream or I’ll give him this sort of sad look, like I think I must have disappointed him.” Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another mas- ter. “You’ve had lessons on how to manipulate people?” “Of course,” Draco said proudly. “I’m a Malfoy. Father bought me tu- tors.” “Wow,” Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini’s Influence: Science and Prac- tice probably didn’t stack up very high compared to that (though it was still one heck of a book). “Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad.” Draco’s eyebrows rose loftily. “Oh? And what does your father do?” “He buys me books.” Draco considered this. “That doesn’t sound very impressive.” “You had to be there. Anyway, I’m glad to hear all that. The way Lucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify you.” “My father really loves me,” Draco said firmly. “He wouldn’t ever do that.” “Um…” Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired fig- ure of elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin’s, wielding that beautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn’t easy to visualise him as a doting father. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but how do you know that?” “Huh?” It was clear that this was a question Draco did not commonly ask himself. “I ask the fundamental question of rationality: why do you believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? What makes you think Lucius wouldn’t sacrifice you the same way he’d sacrifice anything else for power?” Draco shot Harry another odd look. “Just what do you know about Fa- ther?” “Um…seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts’ Board of Governors, incredibly wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has the confidence of Minister Fudge, probably has some highly embarrassing photos of Min- ister Fudge, most prominent blood purist now that the Dark Lord’s gone, former Death Eater who was found to have the Dark Mark but got off by claiming to be under the Imperius Curse, which was ridiculously implau- sible and pretty much everyone knew it…evil with a capital ‘E’ and a born killer…I think that’s it.” Draco’s eyes had narrowed to slits. “McGonagall told you that, did she.” “No, she wouldn’t say anything to me about Lucius afterwards, except to stay away from him. So during the Incident at the Potions Shop, while Professor McGonagall was busy yelling at the shopkeeper and trying to get everything under control, I grabbed one of the customers and asked them about Lucius.” Draco’s eyes were wide again. “Did you really?” Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. “If I lied the first time, I’m not going to tell you the truth just because you ask twice.” There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this. “You’re so completely going to be in Slytherin.” “I’m so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very much. I only want power so I can get books.” Draco giggled. “Yeah, right. Anyway…to answer what you asked…” Draco took a deep breath, and his face turned serious. “Father once missed a Wizengamot vote for me. I was on a broom and I fell off and broke a lot of ribs. It really hurt. I’d never hurt that much before and I thought I was going to die. So Father missed this really important vote, because he was there by my bed at St. Mungo’s, holding my hands and promising me that I was going to be okay.” Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced him- self to look back at Draco. “Why are you telling me that? It seems sort of… private…” Draco gave Harry a serious look. “One of my tutors once said that peo- ple form close friendships by knowing private things about each other, and the reason most people don’t make close friends is because they’re too embarrassed to share anything really important about themselves.” Draco turned his palms out invitingly. “Your turn?” Knowing that Draco’s hopeful face had probably been drilled into him by months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry observed. Actually it did make it less effective, but unfortunately not ineffective. The same could be said of Draco’s clever use of reciprocation pressure with an unsolicited gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social psychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in getting people to fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited gift of a confidence, and now invited Harry to offer a confidence in return…and the thing was, Harry did feel pressured. Refusal, Harry was certain, would be met with a look of sad disappointment, and maybe a small amount of contempt indicating that Harry had lost points. “Draco,” Harry said, “just so you know, I recognise exactly what you’re doing right now. My own books called it reciprocation and they talk about how giving someone a straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as effective as offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you want…” Harry trailed off. Draco was looking sad and disappointed. “It’s not meant as a trick, Harry. It’s a real way of becoming friends.” Harry held up a hand. “I didn’t say I wasn’t going to respond. I just need time to pick something that’s private but just as non-damaging. Let’s say…I wanted you to know that I can’t be rushed into things.” A pause to reflect could go a long way in defusing the power of a lot of compliance techniques, once you learned to recognise them for what they were. “All right,” Draco said. “I’ll wait while you come up with something. Oh, and please take off the scarf while you say it.” Simple but effective. And Harry couldn’t help but notice how clumsy, awkward, graceless his attempt at resisting manipulation / saving face / showing off had ap- peared compared to Draco. I need those tutors. “All right,” Harry said after a time. “Here’s mine.” He glanced around and then rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing everything but the scar. “Um…it sounds like you can really rely on your father. I mean…if you talk to him seriously, he’ll always listen to you and take you seriously.” Draco nodded. “Sometimes,” Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly hard, but then it was meant to be. “Sometimes I wish my own Dad was like yours.” Harry’s eyes flinched away from Draco’s face, more or less auto- matically, and then Harry forced himself to look back at Draco. Then it hit Harry what on Earth he’d just said, and Harry hastily added, “Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless instrument of death like Lucius, I only mean taking me seriously—” “I understand,” Draco said with a smile. “There…now doesn’t it feel like we’re a little closer to being friends?” Harry nodded. “Yeah. It does, actually. Um…no offence, but I’m going to put on my disguise again, I really don’t want to deal with—” “I understand.” Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face. “My father takes all his friends seriously,” Draco said. “That’s why he has lots of friends. You should meet him.” “I’ll think about it,” Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook his head in wonder. “So you really are his one weak point. Huh.” Now Draco was giving Harry a really odd look. “You want to go get something to drink and find somewhere to sit down?” Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long, and stretched himself, trying to crick his back. “Sure.” The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a quieter area on the far side away from the red steam engine. Along the way they passed a stall containing a bald, bearded man offering newspapers and comic books and stacked neon-green cans. The stall-holder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of one of the neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the refined and elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along with a mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid with a scarf tied over his face, causing the stall-holder to experience a sudden coughing fit in mid-drink and dribble a large amount of neon-green liquid onto his beard. “’Scuse me,” Harry said, “but what is that stuff, exactly?” “Comed-Tea,” said the stall-holder “If you drink it, something surpris- ing is bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself or someone else. But it’s charmed to vanish just a few seconds later—” Indeed the stain on his beard was already disappearing. “How droll,” said Draco. “How very, very droll. Come, Mr Bronze, let’s go find another—” “Hold on,” Harry said. “Oh come on! That’s just, just juvenile!” “No, I’m sorry Draco, I have to investigate this. What happens if I drink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the conversation completely se- rious?” The stall-holder smiled mysteriously. “Who knows? A friend walks by in a frog costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen—” “No. I’m sorry. I just don’t believe it. That violates my much-abused suspension of disbelief on so many levels I don’t even have the language to describe it. There is, there is just no way a bloody drink can manipulate reality to produce comedy setups, or I’m going to give up and retire to the Bahamas—” Draco groaned. “Are we really going to do this?” “You don’t have to drink it but I have to investigate. Have to. How much?” “Five Knuts the can,” the stall-holder said. “Five Knuts? You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy drinks for five Knuts the can?” Harry reached into his pouch, said “four Sickles, four Knuts,” and slapped them down on the counter. “Two dozen cans please.” “I’ll also take one,” Draco sighed, and started to reach for his pockets. Harry shook his head rapidly. “No, I’ve got this, doesn’t count as a favour either, I want to see if it works for you too.” He took a can from the stack now placed on the counter and tossed it to Draco, then started feeding his pouch. The pouch’s Widening Lip ate the cans accompanied by small burping noises, which wasn’t exactly helping to restore Harry’s faith that he would some day discover a reasonable explanation for all this. Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his hand, Draco was looking at him expectantly, and the two of them pulled the ring at the same time. Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted their heads back and drank the Comed-Tea. It somehow tasted bright green—extra-fizzy and limer than lime. Aside from that, nothing else happened. Harry looked at the stall-holder, who was watching them benevo- lently. All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural accident to sell me twenty- four cans of nothing, I’m going to applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit and then kill him. “It doesn’t always happen immediately,” the stall-holder said. “But it’s guaranteed to happen once per can, or your money back.” Harry took another long drink. Once again, nothing happened. Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as possible…and hope my stomach doesn’t explode from all the carbon dioxide, or that I don’t burp while drinking it… No, he could afford to be a little patient. But honestly, Harry didn’t see how this was going to work. You couldn’t go up to someone and say “Now I’m going to surprise you” or “And now I’m going to tell you the punchline of the joke, and it’ll be really funny.” It ruined the shock value. In Harry’s state of mental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in a ballerina outfit and it wouldn’t have made him do a proper spit-take. Just what sort of wacky shenanigan was the universe supposed to cough up now? “Anyway, let’s sit down,” Harry said. He prepared to swig another drink and started towards the distant seating area, which put him at the right angle to glance back and see the portion of the stall’s newspaper stand that was devoted to a newspaper called The Quibbler, which was showing the following headline: Boy-Who-Lived Gets Draco Malfoy Pregnant “Gah!” screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed all over him from Harry’s direction. Draco turned to Harry with fire in his eyes and grabbed his own can. “You son of a mudblood! Let’s see how you like being spat upon!” Draco took a deliberate swig from the can just as his own eyes caught sight of the headline. In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the spray of liq- uid flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked using the hand con- taining the Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the green liquid to splash out over his shoulder. Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking and spluttering and the green colour started to vanish from Draco’s robes. Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline. Boy-Who-Lived Gets Draco Malfoy Pregnant Harry’s lips opened and said, “buh-bluh-buh-buh…” Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every time Harry tried to say “But we’re only eleven!” the objection “But men can’t get pregnant!” demanded first priority and was then run over by “But there’s nothing between us, really!” Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again. He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the top of his lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only thing stop- ping him was that he had once read that outright panic was the sign of a truly important scientific problem. Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish bin, and stalked back over to the stall. “One copy of The Quibbler, please.” Harry paid over four more Knuts, retrieved another can of Comed-Tea from his pouch, and then stalked over to the picnic area with the blond-haired boy, who was staring at his own can with an expression of frank admiration. “I take it back,” Draco said, “that was pretty good.” “Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming friends than exchanging secrets? Committing murder.” “I have a tutor who says that,” Draco allowed. He reached inside his robes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion. “Who’ve you got in mind?” Harry slammed The Quibbler down hard on the picnic table. “The guy who came up with this headline.” Draco groaned. “Not a guy. A girl. A ten-year-old girl, can you believe it? She went nuts after her mother died and her father, who owns this newspaper, is convinced that she’s a seer, so when he doesn’t know he asks Luna Lovegood and believes anything she says.” Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next can of Comed-Tea and prepared to drink. “Are you kidding me? That’s even worse than Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was physically impossible.” Draco snarled. “She has some sort of perverse obsession about the Malfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he prints every word. As soon as I’m old enough I’m going to rape her.” Green liquid spurted out of Harry’s nostrils, soaking into the scarf still covering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix, and Harry spent the next few seconds frantically coughing. Draco looked at him sharply. “Something wrong?” It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation that (a) the sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had turned into more of a blurred white noise at around the same time Draco had reached inside his robes, and (b) when he had discussed committing murder as a bonding method, there had been exactly one person in the conversation who’d thought they were joking. Right. Because he seemed like such a normal kid. And he is a normal kid, he is just what you’d expect a baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father. “Yes, well,” Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out of this conversational wedge, “I was just surprised at how you were willing to discuss it so openly, you didn’t seem worried about getting caught or any- thing.” Draco snorted. “Are you joking? Luna Lovegood’s word against mine?” Holy crap on a holy stick. “There’s no such thing as magical truth de- tection, I take it?” Or DNA testing…yet. Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. “That’s right, you don’t know anything. Look, I’ll explain things to you, I mean the way it really works, just like you were already in Slytherin and asked me the same question. But you’ve got to swear not to say anything about it.” “I swear,” Harry said. “The courts use Veritaserum, but it’s a joke really, you just get your- self Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other person was Memory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you’re just some nor- mal person, the courts presume in favour of Obliviation, not False Mem- ory Charms. But the court has discretion, and if I’m involved then it im- pinges on the honour of a Noble House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the votes. After I’m found not guilty the Lovegood fam- ily has to pay reparations for tarnishing my honour. And they know from the start that’s how it’ll go, so they’ll just keep their mouths shut.” A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with instructions to keep his voice and face normal. Note to self: Overthrow government of mag- ical Britain at earliest convenience. Harry coughed again to clear his throat. “Draco, please please please don’t take this the wrong way, my word is my bond, but like you said I could be in Slytherin and I really want to ask for informational purposes, so what would happen theoretically speaking if I did testify that I’d heard you plan it?” “Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I’d be in trouble,” Draco answered smugly. “Since I am a Malfoy…Father has the votes. And after- wards he’d crush you…well, I guess not easily, since you are the Boy-Who- Lived, but Father is pretty good at that sort of thing.” Draco frowned. “’Sides, you talked about murdering her, why weren’t you worried about me testifying after she turns up dead?” How, oh how did my day go this wrong? Harry’s mouth was already mov- ing faster than he could think. “That’s when I thought she was older! I don’t know how it works here, but in Muggle Britain the courts would get a lot more upset about someone killing a child—” “That makes sense,” Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious. “But any- way, it’s always smarter if it doesn’t go to the Aurors at all. If we’re careful only to do things that Healing Charms can fix, we can just Obliviate her af- terwards and then do it all again next week.” Then the blonde-haired boy giggled, a youthful high-pitched sound. “Though just imagine her saying she’d been done by Draco Malfoy and the Boy-Who-Lived, not even Dum- bledore would believe her.” I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms. “Actually, can we hold off on that? After I found out that headline came from a girl a year younger than me, I had a different thought for my revenge.” “Huh? Do tell,” Draco said, and started to take another swig of his Comed-Tea. Harry didn’t know if the enchantment worked more than once per can, but he did know he could avoid the blame, so he was careful to time it exactly right: “I was thinking some day I’m going to marry that woman.” Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid out the corners of his mouth like a broken car radiator. “Are you nuts?” “Quite the opposite, I’m so sane it burns like ice.” “You’ve got weirder taste than a Lestrange,” Draco said, sounding half- admiring about it. “And I suppose you want her all to yourself, huh?” “Yep. I can owe you a favour for it—” Draco waved it off. “Nah, this one’s free.” Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling into his blood. Charming, happy, generous with his favours to his friends, Draco wasn’t a psychopath. That was the sad and awful part, knowing human psychology well enough to know that Draco wasn’t a monster. There had been ten thousand societies over the history of the world where this con- versation could have happened. No, the world would have been a very dif- ferent place indeed, if it took an evil mutant to say what Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the default if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren’t people. And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a suf- ficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl. There were places in Muggle-land where it was still the same way, countries where that sort of nobility still existed and still thought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn’t just the nobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn’t descend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it seemed, which didn’t quite include magical Britain, for all that there had been cross-cultural contamination of things like ring-pull drinks cans. And if Draco doesn’t change his mind about wanting revenge, and I don’t throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry some poor crazy girl, then all I’ve just bought is time, and not too much of it… For one girl. Not for others. I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top blood purists and kill them. They’d tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or less— make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove everything above the neck—and it hadn’t worked out well from what Harry recalled. Maybe he needed to dust off some of those history books his father had bought him, and see if what had gone wrong with the French Revolution was some- thing easy to fix. Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon, visible this morning through the cloudless air. So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and bloody and dark. This is news? You always knew that, anyway… “You’re looking all serious,” Draco said. “Let me guess, your Muggle parents told you that this sort of thing was bad.” Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice. “Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the end every- one belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And frankly, you’re not on the Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side with the Malfoys under the ta- ble…our power and your reputation…you could get away with things even I can’t do. Want to try it for a while? See what it’s like?” Aren’t we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and already coaxing your prey from hiding… Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. “Draco, you want to explain the whole blood purity thing to me? I’m sort of new.” A wide smile crossed Draco’s face. “You really should meet Father and ask him, you know, he’s our leader.” “Give me the thirty-second version.” “Okay,” Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grew slightly lower, and took on a cadence. “Our powers have grown weaker, generation by generation, as the mudblood taint increases. Where Salazar and Godric and Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts by their power, creating the Locket and the Sword and the Diadem and the Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen to rival them. We are fading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with their spawn and allow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked, soon our wands will break and all our arts cease, the line of Merlin will end and the blood of Atlantis fail. Our children will be left scratching at the dirt to survive like the mere Muggles, and darkness will cover all the world for ever.” Draco took another swig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed to be the whole argument as far as he was concerned. “Persuasive,” Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than norma- tively. It was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the need to guard what purity remained against contamination, the past sloping upwards and the future sloping only down. And that pattern also had its counter…“I have to correct you on one point of fact, though. Your information about the Muggles is a bit out of date. We aren’t exactly scratching at the dirt any more.” Draco’s head snapped around. “What? What do you mean, we?” “We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of the Enlightenment. Muggles didn’t just sit around crying about not having wands, we have our own powers now, with or without magic. If all your powers fail then we will all have lost something very precious, because your magic is the only hint we have as to how the universe must really work—but you won’t be left scratching at the ground. Your houses will still be cool in summer and warm in winter, there will still be doctors and medicine. Science can keep you alive if magic fails. It’d be a tragedy, but not literally the end of all the light in the world. Just saying.” Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed fear and disbelief. “What in the name of Merlin are you talking about, Potter?” “Hey, I listened to your story, won’t you listen to mine?” Clumsy, Harry chided himself, but Draco actually did stop backing off and seem to listen. “Anyway,” Harry said, “I’m saying that you don’t seem to have been paying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world.” Probably because the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the rest of Earth as a slum, deserving around as much news coverage as the Financial Times awarded to the routine agonies of Burundi. “All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever been to the Moon? You know, that thing?” Harry pointed up to that huge and distant globe. “What?” Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought had never occurred to the boy. “Go to the—it’s just a—” His finger pointed at the little pale thingy in the sky. “You can’t Apparate to somewhere you’ve never been and how would anyone get to the Moon in the first place?” “Hold on,” Harry said to Draco, “I’d like to show you a book I brought with me, I think I remember what box it’s in.” And Harry stood up and knelt down and yanked out the stairs to the cavern level of his trunk, then tore down the stairs and heaved a box off another box, coming perilously close to treating his books with disrespect, and snatched off the box cover and quickly but carefully pried out a stack of books— (Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to remember where all his books were, even after seeing them just once, which was rather mysterious considering the lack of any genetic connection.) And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back into the trunk with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the book until he found the picture he wanted to show to Draco. The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited people, and the blue-white globe hanging over it all. That picture. The picture, if only one picture in all the world were to survive. “That,” Harry said, his voice trembling because he couldn’t quite keep the pride out, “is what the Earth looks like from the Moon.” Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on his young face. “If that’s a real picture, why isn’t it moving?” Moving? Oh. “Muggles can do moving pictures but they need a bigger box to show it, they can’t fit them onto single book pages yet.” Draco’s finger moved to one of the suits. “What are those?” His voice starting to waver. “Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover their whole bodies to give them air, because there is no air on the Moon.” “That’s impossible,” Draco whispered. There was terror in his eyes, and utter confusion. “No Muggle could ever do that. How…” Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what he saw. “This is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and higher, until it gets to the Moon.” Flipped pages again. “This is a rocket on the ground. That tiny speck next to it is a person.” Draco gasped. “Going to the Moon cost the equivalent of…probably around a thousand million Galleons.” Draco choked. “And it took the efforts of…probably more people than live in all of magical Britain.” And when they arrived, they left a plaque that said, ‘We came in peace, for all mankind.’ Though you’re not yet ready to hear those words, Draco Malfoy… “You’re telling the truth,” Draco said slowly. “You wouldn’t fake a whole book just for this—and I can hear it in your voice. But…but…” “How, without wands or magic? It’s a long story, Draco. Science doesn’t work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by knowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know exactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want. If magic is like casting Imperio on someone to make them do what you want, then science is like knowing them so well that you can convince them it was their own idea all along. It’s a lot more difficult than waving a wand, but it works when wands fail, just like if the Imperius failed you could still try persuad- ing a person. And Science builds from generation to generation. You have to really know what you’re doing to do science—and when you really understand something, you can explain it to someone else. The greatest scientists of one century ago, the brightest names that are still spoken with reverence, their powers are as nothing to the greatest scientists of today. There is no equivalent in science of your lost arts that raised Hog- warts. In science our powers wax by the year. And we are beginning to understand and unravel the secrets of life and inheritance. We’ll be able to look at the very blood of which you spoke, and see what makes you a wizard, and in one or two more generations, we’ll be able to persuade that blood to make all your children powerful wizards too. So you see, your problem isn’t nearly as bad as it looks, because in a few more decades, science will be able to solve it for you.” “But…” Draco said. His voice was trembling. “If Muggles have that kind of power…then…what are we?” “No, Draco, that’s not it, don’t you see? Science taps the power of hu- man understanding to look at the world and figure out how it works. It can’t fail without humanity itself failing. Your magic could turn off, and you would hate that, but you would still be you. You would still be alive to regret it. But because science rests upon my human intelligence, it is the power that cannot be removed from me without removing me. Even if the laws of the universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is void, I’ll just figure out the new laws, as has been done before. It’s not a Muggle thing, it’s a human thing, it just refines and trains the power you use every time you look at something you don’t understand and ask ‘Why?’ You’re of Slytherin, Draco, don’t you see the implication?” Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawning understanding. “Wizards can learn to use this power.” Very carefully, now…the bait is set, now the hook…“If you can learn to think of yourself as a human instead of a wizard then you can train and refine your powers as a human.” And if that instruction wasn’t in every science curriculum, Draco didn’t need to know it, did he? Draco’s eyes were now thoughtful. “You’ve…already done this?” “To some extent,” Harry allowed. “My training isn’t complete. Not at eleven. But—my father also bought me tutors, you see.” Sure, they’d been starving grad students, and it had only been because Harry slept on a 26- hour cycle, but leave all that aside for now… Slowly, Draco nodded. “You think you can master both arts, add the powers together, and…” Draco stared at Harry. “Make yourself Lord of the two worlds?” Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at that point. “You have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you know, all of mag- ical Britain, is just one square on a much larger game board. The game board that includes places like the Moon, and the stars in the night sky, which are lights just like the Sun only unimaginably far away, and things like galaxies that are vastly huger than the Earth and Sun, things so large that only scientists can see them and you don’t even know they exist. But I really am Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don’t want to rule the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly organised.” There was awe on Draco’s face. “Why are you telling me this?” “Oh…there aren’t many people who know how to do true science— understanding something for the very first time, even if it confuses the hell out of you. Help would be helpful.” Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open. “But make no mistake, Draco, true science really isn’t like magic, you can’t just do it and walk away unchanged like learning how to say the words of a new spell. The power comes with a cost, a cost so high that most people refuse to pay it.” Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he’d heard something he could understand. “And that cost?” “Learning to admit you’re wrong.” “Um,” Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for a while. “You going to explain that?” “Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level, the first ninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The hundredth is right. So you have to learn how to admit you’re wrong, over and over and over again. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s so hard that most people can’t do science. Always questioning yourself, always taking another look at things you’ve always taken for granted,” like having a Snitch in Quid- ditch, “and every time you change your mind, you change yourself. But I’m getting way ahead of myself here. Way ahead of myself. I just want you to know…I’m offering to share some of my knowledge. If you want. There’s just one condition.” “Uh huh,” Draco said. “You know, Father says that when someone says that to you, it is never a good sign, ever.” Harry nodded. “Now, don’t mistake me and think that I’m trying to drive a wedge between you and your father. It’s not about that. It’s just about me wanting to deal with someone my own age, rather than having this be between me and Lucius. I think your father would be okay with that too, he knows you have to grow up sometime. But your moves in our game have to be your own. That’s my condition—that I’m dealing with you, Draco, not your father.” “I’ve got to go,” Draco said. He stood up. “I’ve got to go off and think about this.” “Take your time,” Harry said. The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmurs as Draco wandered off. Harry slowly exhaled the air he’d been holding in without quite real- ising it, and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple mechanical model that his father had bought him in hope it would work in magic’s presence. The second-hand was still ticking, and if the minute hand was right, then it wasn’t quite eleven just yet. He probably ought to get on the train soon and start looking for whatsherface, but it seemed worth tak- ing a few minutes first to do some breathing exercises and see if his blood warmed up again. But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures ap- proaching, looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by winter scarves. “Hello, Mr Bronze,” said one of the masked figures. “Can we interest you in joining the Order of Chaos?” 100 RECIPROCATION 101 Dear Father: CH APTER 7 102 103 CH APTER 8 104 POSITI V E BIA S 105 CH APTER 8 106 POSITI V E BIA S 107 CH APTER 8 108 POSITI V E BIA S 109 CH APTER 8 110 POSITI V E BIA S 111 CH APTER 8 112 POSITI V E BIA S 113 CH APTER 8 114 POSITI V E BIA S 115 CH APTER 8 116 POSITI V E BIA S 117 CH APTER 8 118 119 CH APTER 9 12 0 SELF AWARE NESS I 121 CH APTER 9 12 2 SELF AWARE NESS I “Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!” With all too good a notion of what she would see, Minerva McGonagall turned to look behind herself at the rest of the Head Table. Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking on with curios- ity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector and Sinistra bemused, and Quirrell gazing vacuously at nothing. Albus smiling benev- olently. And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white- knuckled, so hard that the silver was slowly deforming. With a wide grin, turning his head to bow to one side and then the other as he walked between the four House tables, Harry Potter walked forwards at a grandly measured pace, a prince inheriting his castle. “Save us from some more Dark Lords!” called one of the Weasley twins, and then the other Weasley twin cried, “Especially if they’re Professors!” to general laughter from all the tables except Slytherin. Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with the Weasley Horrors about that last part, if they thought she was powerless because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to take away. If they didn’t care about detentions then she would find something else. Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Severus’s direction, surely he realized the Potter boy must have no idea who that was talking about— Severus’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indiffer- ence. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet. 124 SELF AWARE NESS I 125 127 CH APTER 10 128 SELF AWARE NESS II 129 CH APTER 10 130 SELF AWARE NESS II 131 CH APTER 10 132 SELF AWARE NESS II 133 CH APTER 10 134 SELF AWARE NESS II 135 CH APTER 10 136 SELF AWARE NESS II 137 139 CH APTER 12 140 IMPULSE CONTROL 141 CH APTER 12 142 IMPULSE CONTROL 143 CH APTER 12 144 IMPULSE CONTROL 145 CH APTER 12 146 IMPULSE CONTROL 147 CH APTER 12 148 IMPULSE CONTROL 149 CH APTER 12 150 151 CH APTER 13 152 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 153 CH APTER 13 154 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 155 CH APTER 13 156 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 157 CH APTER 13 158 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 159 CH APTER 13 160 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 161 CH APTER 13 162 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 163 CH APTER 13 164 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 165 CH APTER 13 166 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 167 CH APTER 13 168 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 169 CH APTER 13 170 A SKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS 171 173 CH APTER 14 174 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE 175 CH APTER 14 176 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE 177 CH APTER 14 178 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE 179 CH APTER 14 180 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE 181 CH APTER 14 182 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his robes pulled up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in case someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time as Harry lying in his bed. He didn’t want to have to explain to anyone about his little medical problem with Spontaneous Duplication. Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep. And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green paper with a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The perfect, stereotyp- ical image of a Christmas present, although it wasn’t Christmas. Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case someone had their Quieter turned down low. There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear wax without a seal impressed. Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter inside. The letter said: This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell, passed down through his descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser cloaks and spells it has the power to keep you hidden, not merely invisible. Your father lent it to me to study shortly before he died, and I confess that I have received much good use of it over the years. In the future I shall have to get along with Disillusionment, I fear. It is time the Cloak was returned to you, its heir. I had thought to make this a Christmas present, but it wished to come back to your hand before then. It seems to expect you to have need of it. Use it well. No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of w onderful pranks, as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds were known, every w oman in Gryffindor w ould gather to desecrate his grave. I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be most careful not to reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he w ould never let it escape his grasp until the day he died. A Very Merry Christmas to you. The note was unsigned. 184 THE UNKNOW N AND THE UNKNOWABLE 185 CH APTER 14 “I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion Flubberwalt,” said the painting of a man with aristocratic airs and, in fact, a perfectly normal nose. “But might I ask where it came from originally?” Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. “I was told that it was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss.” Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. “And how do you know what the Slytherins are planning?” “I can’t name my source,” Harry said. “In fact I have to ask you to pre- tend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you happened across them naturally while you were on an errand, or something. I’ll run on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think I can distract the Slythe- rins until you get there. I’m not easy to scare or bully, and I don’t think they’ll dare to seriously hurt the Boy-Who-Lived. Though…I’m not asking you to run in the hallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn’t dawdle along the way.” Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her expres- sion softened. “Please be careful with yourself, Harry Potter. And…thank you.” “Just be sure not to be late,” Harry said. “And remember, when you get there, you weren’t expecting to see me and this conversation never happened.” 187 189 CH APTER 15 “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. There was no trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.” Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped itself into a pig. A couple of Muggle-born students gave out small yelps. The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and then became a desk again. The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and then her eyes settled on one student. “Mr Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “You only received your schoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your Transfigura- tion textbook?” “No, sorry professor,” Harry said. “You needn’t apologise, Mr Potter, if you were required to read ahead you would have been told to do so.” McGonagall’s fingers rapped the desk in front of her. “Mr Potter, would you care to guess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if it began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration? If you had read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know.” Harry’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “I’d guess it’d be easier to start with a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know how to stand up.” Professor McGonagall shook her head. “No fault to you, Mr Potter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do not care to guess. Wrong answers will be marked with extreme severity, questions left blank will be marked with great leniency. You must learn to know what you do not know. If I ask you any question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you answer ‘I’m not sure’, I will not hold it against you and anyone who laughs will lose House points. Can you tell me why this rule exists, Mr Potter?” Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly dangerous. “No.” “Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition, which is not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately, Transfiguration must be learned and practised at a young age to maximise your adult ability. So this is a dangerous subject, and you should be quite scared of making any mistakes, because none of my students have ever been permanently injured and I will be extremely put out if you are the first class to spoil my record.” Several students gulped. Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind her desk, which held a polished wooden board. “There are many reasons why Transfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands above all the rest.” She produced a short quill with a thick end and used it to sketch letters in red, which she then underlined, using the same marker, in blue: TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT PERMANENT! I “Transfiguration is not permanent!” said Professor McGonagall. “Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not permanent! Mr Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of wood into a cup of water, and you drank it. What do you imagine might happen to you when the Transfiguration wore off?” There was a pause. “Excuse me, I should not have asked that of you, Mr Potter, I forgot that you are blessed with an unusually pessimistic imagination—” “I’m fine,” Harry said, swallowing hard. “So the first answer is that I don’t know,” the Professor nodded approvingly, “but I imagine there might be…wood in my stomach, and in my bloodstream, and if any of that water had been absorbed into my body’s tissues—would it be wood pulp or solid wood or…” Harry’s grasp of magic failed him. He couldn’t understand how wood mapped into water in the first place, so he couldn’t understand what would happen after the water molecules were scrambled by ordinary ther- mal motions and the magic wore off and the mapping reversed. McGonagall’s face was stiff. “As Mr Potter has correctly reasoned, he would become extremely sick and require immediate Flooing to St. Mungo’s Hospital if he was to have any chance of survival. Please turn your textbooks to page 5.” Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell that the woman with horribly discoloured skin was screaming. “The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and gave it to this woman to drink, ‘in payment of the debt’ as he put it, received a sen- tence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to page 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They suck away at your magic, your life, and any happy thoughts you try to have. The picture on page 7 is of the criminal ten years later, on his release. You will note that he is dead— yes, Mr Potter?” “Professor,” Harry said, “if the worst happens in a case like that, is there any way of maintaining the Transfiguration?” “No,” Professor McGonagall said flatly. “Sustaining a Transfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales with the size of the target form. And you would need to re-contact the target every few hours, which is, in a case like this, impossible. Disasters like this are unrecoverable!” Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. “You will absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything into a liq- uid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water, nothing like air. Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid evaporates, little bits and pieces of it get into the air. You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. It will make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never Transfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone’s body by any means. No food. Nothing that looks like food. Not even as a funny little prank where you mean to tell them about your mud pie before they actually eat it. You will never do it. Period. Inside this classroom or out of it or anywhere. Is that well understood by every single student?” “Yes,” said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed to be speechless. “Is that well understood by every single student?” “Yes,” they said or muttered or whispered. “If you break any of these rules you will not further study Transfigu- ration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me. I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.” “I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas,” said the stu- dents in ragged chorus. “Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.” “I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.” “I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything else that goes inside a human body.” “I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because it could make smoke.” “You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money, includ- ing Muggle money,” said Professor McGonagall. “The goblins have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law, the goblin nation is in a permanent state of war with all magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send an army.” “I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,” repeated the students. “And above all,” said Professor McGonagall, “you will not Transfigure any living subject, especially yourselves. It will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change.” Professor McGonagall paused. “Mr Pot- ter is currently holding up his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation—specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But an Animagus transformation is not free Transfiguration.” Professor McGonagall took a small chunk of wood out of her pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she said “Crystferrium!” and the glass ball became a steel ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball became a piece of wood once more. “Crystfer- rium transforms a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a pig. The most general form of Transfiguration—free Transfiguration, which you will be learning here—is capable of transforming any subject into any target, at least so far as physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration must be done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation between subject and target.” Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look. “Some teachers begin with Transfiguration Charms and move on to free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, that would be much easier in the beginning. But it can set you in a poor mould which impairs your abilities later. Here you will learn free Transfiguration from the very start, which requires that you cast the spell wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the target form, and the transformation within your own mind.” “And to answer Mr Potter’s question,” Professor McGonagall went on, “it is free Transfiguration which you must never do to any living subject. There are Charms and potions which can safely, reversibly transform liv- ing subjects in limited ways. An Animagus with a missing limb will still be missing that limb after transforming, for example. Free Transfiguration is not safe. Your body will change while it is Transfigured—breathing, for example, results in a constant loss of the body’s stuff to the surrounding air. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body tries to revert to its original form, it will not quite be able to do so. If you press your wand to your body and imagine yourself with golden hair, afterwards your hair will fall out. If you visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, you will be taking a long stay at St. Mungo’s. And if you Transfigure yourself into an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears off, you will die.” That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls less than perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That wouldn’t hap- pen if you could just Transfigure yourself every morning…Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor McGonagall with his eyes. “Yes, Mr Potter?” “Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target that is static, such as a coin—no, excuse me, I’m terribly sorry, let’s just say a steel ball.” Professor McGonagall shook her head. “Mr Potter, even inanimate ob- jects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute, you would no- tice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick, and in a day you would be dead.” “Erm, excuse me, so if I’d read the first chapter I could have guessed that the desk was originally a desk and not a pig,” Harry said, “but only if I made the further assumption that you didn’t want to kill the pig, that might seem highly probable but—” “I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source of de- light to me, Mr Potter. But if you have other questions can I please ask you to wait until after class?” “No further questions, professor.” “Now repeat after me,” said Professor McGonagall. “I will never try to Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless specifically in- structed to do so using a specialised Charm or potion.” “If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not try it until I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor Flitwick or Profes- sor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only recognised authorities on Transfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking another student is not acceptable, even if they say that they remember asking the same question.” “Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that a Transfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor do it and nothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it myself.” “I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any Transfiguration about which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since not even the Headmas- ter of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I certainly will not accept any such order from the Defence Professor, even if the Defence Professor threatens to deduct one hundred House points and have me expelled.” “If I break any of these rules I will not further study Transfiguration during my time at Hogwarts.” “We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the first month,” said Professor McGonagall. “And now, we will begin with matches as subjects and needles as targets…put away your wands, thank you, by ‘begin’ I meant that you will begin taking notes.” Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall handed out the matches. At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and the entire rest of the class, Muggle-born or otherwise, had exactly what they’d started with. Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for Ravenclaw. 196 CONSCIE NTIOUSNESS 197 CH APTER 15 198 CONSCIE NTIOUSNESS 199 2 01 CH APTER 16 2 02 LATERAL THINKING 2 03 CH APTER 16 2 04 LATERAL THINKING At 2:35 p.m., when most of the seats were taken and no-one else seemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in his chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the flat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the students’ desks. Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of Pro- fessor Quirrell’s face and by the resemblance to Muggle television. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that, it seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn’t really… “Good afternoon, my young apprentices,” said Professor Quirrell. His voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking directly to Harry. “Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic, as the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to be called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark Arts.” There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students, taken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks. “No,” Professor Quirrell said. “Don’t bother writing down what this subject was once called. No such pointless question will count toward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise.” Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather shocked. Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. “Those of you who have wasted time by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks—” Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was Hermione. “—may have got the impression that although this subject is called Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to defend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a two-inch wooden beam given most of a day.” Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the desk. The screen on Harry’s desk followed his every move. Professor Quirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and bellowed: “The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes fire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in mid-flight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!” There were gasps from the students. “The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian Horntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is resistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms! Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself—it is always transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll’s regenerative powers—for an hour or two! They are smart enough to use clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect killing machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it down.” The students were looking rather shocked. Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. “Your sad excuse for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you expose the moun- tain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in place. This, my young appren- tices, is the sort of useless knowledge you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show off their mastery of minutiæ at the expense of practicality. Just because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with mountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it! The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can simply Apparate away! Likewise if you are fac- ing the second most perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Appa- rate away!” “Unless, of course,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice now lower and harder, “you are under the influence of an anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes close. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be able to threaten you.” Professor Quirrell’s lips were set in a thin line. “I will reluctantly teach you enough trivia for a passing mark on the Ministry-mandated portions of your first-year exams. Since your exact mark on these sections will make no difference to your future life, anyone who wants more than a passing mark is welcome to waste their own time studying our pathetic excuse for a textbook. The title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are here to learn how to defend yourselves against the Dark Arts. Which means, let us be very clear on this, defending your- selves against Dark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and who will likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no defence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This re- ality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat, overpaid, Auror- guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum. To the abyss with those fools! You are here for the subject that has been taught at Hogwarts for eight hundred years! Welcome to your first year of Battle Magic!” Harry started applauding. He couldn’t help himself, it was too inspir- ing. Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response from Gryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply seemed too stunned to react. Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died in- stantly. “Thank you very much,” said Professor Quirrell. “Now to practical- ities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes into one, which al- lows me to offer you twice as much classroom time as Doubles sessions—” There were gasps of horror. “—an increased load which I will make up to you by not assigning any homework.” The gasps of horror cut off abruptly. “Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to write twelve inches on fighting due Monday.” Harry desperately wished he’d sat next to Hermione so he could see the look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty sure he was imagining it accurately. Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him, the Time-Turner, and Professor Quirrell. “For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some after-school ac- tivities that I think you will find quite interesting as well as educational. Do you want to show the world your own abilities instead of watching four- teen other people play Quidditch? More than seven people can fight in an army.” Hot damn. “These and other after-school activities will also earn you Quirrell points. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point system does not suit my needs, because it makes House points too rare. I prefer to let my students know how they are doing more frequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer you a written test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get too many related questions wrong, your test will show the names of students who got those questions right, and those students will be able to earn Quirrell points by helping you.” …wow. Why didn’t the other professors use a system like that? “What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten Quirrell points will be worth one House point. But they will earn you other favours as well. Would you like to take your exam at an unusual time? Is there a particular session you would very much prefer to skip? You will find that I can be very flexible on behalf of students who have accumulated enough Quirrell points. Quirrell points will control the generalship of the armies. And for Christmas—just before the Christmas break—I will grant some- one a wish. Any school-related feat that lies within my power, my influ- ence, or above all, my ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and I am offering to formulate a cunning plot on your behalf, if that is what it takes to ac- complish your desire. This wish will go to whoever has earned the most Quirrell points within all seven years.” That would be Harry. “Now leave your books and loose items at your desks—they will be safe, the screens will watch over them for you—and come down onto this plat- form. It’s time to play a game called Who’s the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.” 2 09 CH APTER 16 210 LATERAL THINKING 211 CH APTER 16 212 LATERAL THINKING 213 CH APTER 16 214 LATERAL THINKING 215 CH APTER 16 216 LATERAL THINKING 217 CH APTER 16 218 LATERAL THINKING 219 2 21 CH APTER 17 2 2 2 LOCATING THE H YPOTHESIS If you wanted to be specific, 3:32 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a grassy field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply of broom- sticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately. Apparently, for some reason, girls didn’t want to learn how to fly on broomsticks in the presence of boys. Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn’t seem to stop wondering how that particular stable time loop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather large space of possibilities. Also: seriously, broomsticks? He was going to fly on, basically, a line seg- ment? Wasn’t that pretty much the single most unstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting to hold on to a point marble? Who’d se- lected that design for a flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been hoping that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were stand- ing in front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen broomsticks. Had someone just got stuck on the idea of broomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be. There was no way that the optimal designs for cleaning kitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you worked them out from scratch. It was a clear day with a bright-blue sky and a brilliant sun that was just begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to see, if you were trying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice and dry, smelling posi- tively baked, and somehow felt very, very hard under Harry’s shoes. Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator of eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn’t be that hard. “Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if you’re left- handed,” called Madam Hooch. “And say, Up!” “Up!” everyone shouted. The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry’s hand. Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently saying “Up!” was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of the broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch away from their would-be riders. (Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at least as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day. There couldn’t possibly be anything he could master on the first try which would baffle Hermione, and if there was and it turned out to be broomstick riding instead of anything intellectual, Harry would just die.) It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of them. Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around the field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the few children who’d been allowed to fly at home, they hadn’t been taught to do it correctly. Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard.” Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his stom- ach. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle—three—two—” One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy’s screams—of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful rate as he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face— As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own broom- stick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn’t really know what he planned to do with it, he’d had exactly two sessions of Charms and the last one had been the Hover Charm but Harry had only been able to cast the spell successfully one time out of three and he certainly couldn’t levitate whole people— If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself now! “Come back, boy!” shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most unhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control broomstick, from a flying instructor, and a fully automatic section of Harry’s brain added Madam Hooch to his tally of fools). And the boy was thrown off the broomstick. He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first. “Wingardium Leviosa!” screamed Harry. The spell failed. He could feel it fail. There was a thud and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay face down on the grass in a heap. Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He arrived at the boy’s side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and Harry reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was the name never mind he’d just try “Healer’s Pack!” and it popped up into his hand and— “Broken wrist,” Madam Hooch said. “Calm down, boy, he just has a broken wrist!” There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry’s mind snapped out of Panic Mode. The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and there was a syringe of liquid fire in Harry’s hand, which would have kept the boy’s brain oxygenated if he’d managed to snap his neck. “Ah…” Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart was pounding so loudly that he almost couldn’t hear himself panting for breath. “Broken bone…right…Setting String?” “That’s for emergencies only,” snapped Madam Hooch. “Put it away, he’s fine.” She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand. “Come on, boy, it’s all right, up you get!” “You’re not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick again?” Harry said in horror. Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. “Of course not!” She pulled the boy to his feet using his good arm—Harry saw with a shock that it was Neville Longbottom again, what was with him?—and she turned to all the watch- ing children. “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his wrist and trying to control his sniffles. When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started giggling. That set off the others. Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to mem- orise some faces. And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied by Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle. Mr Crabbe wasn’t smiling. Mr Goyle decid- edly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face that twitched occasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco thought it was hilari- ous but saw no political advantage to be gained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin dungeons afterwards. “Well, Potter,” Draco said in a low voice that didn’t carry, still with that very controlled face that was twitching occasionally, “Just wanted to say, when you take advantage of emergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look like you’re in total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a complete panic.” Mr Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling look. “But you probably scored a few points anyway. You need any help stowing that healer’s kit?” Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face turned away from Draco. “I think I’m fine,” Harry said. He put the syringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up. Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back into his mokeskin pouch. “Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff,” Ernie Macmillan said formally. “It was a good try and a good thought.” “A good thought indeed,” drawled Draco. “Why didn’t anyone in Huf- flepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you’d all helped instead of just Potter, you could’ve caught him. I thought Hufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?” Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting to die of shame. “We didn’t think of it in time—” “Ah,” said Draco, “didn’t think of it, I guess that’s why it’s better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend than all of Hufflepuff.” Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one…“You’re not help- ing,” Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would interpret that as you’re interfering with my plans, please shut up. “Hey, what’s this?” said Mr Goyle. He stooped to the grass and picked up something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball that seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist. Ernie blinked. “Neville’s Remembrall!” “What’s a Remembrall?” asked Harry. “It turns red if you’ve forgotten something,” Ernie said. “It doesn’t tell you what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and I’ll hand it back to Neville later.” Ernie held out his hand. A sudden grin flashed across Mr Goyle’s face and he spun around and raced away. Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted “Hey!” and ran after Mr Goyle. And Mr Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth mo- tion and took to the air. Harry’s jaw dropped. Hadn’t Madam Hooch said that would get him expelled? “That idiot!” Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to shout— “Hey!” shouted Ernie. “That’s Neville’s! Give it back!” The Slytherins started cheering and hooting. Draco’s mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of indeci- sion on his face. “Draco,” Harry said in a low tone, “if you don’t order that idiot back on the ground, the teacher’s going to get back and—” “Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!” shouted Mr Goyle, and a great cheer went up from the Slytherins. “I can’t!” whispered Draco. “Everyone in Slytherin would think I’m weak!” “And if Mr Goyle gets expelled,” hissed Harry, “your father is going to think you’re a moron!” Draco’s face twisted in agony. At that moment— “Hey, Slytherslime,” shouted Ernie, “didn’t anyone ever tell you that Hufflepuffs stick together? Wands out, Hufflepuff!” And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr Goyle’s direction. Three seconds later— “Wands out, Slytherin!” said around five different Slytherins. And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff’s direction. Two seconds later— “Wands out, Gryffindor!” “Do something, Potter!” whispered Draco. “I can’t be the one to stop this it has to be you! I’ll owe you a favour just think of something aren’t you supposed to be brilliant?” In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was going to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was over and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left in his year would be Ravenclaws. “Wands out, Ravenclaw!” shouted Michael Corner who was appar- ently feeling left out of the disaster. “GREGORY GOYLE!” screamed Harry. “I challenge you to a con- test for possession of Neville’s Remembrall!” There was a sudden pause. “Oh, really?” said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever heard. “That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?” Er… “Contest” had been as far as Harry’s inspiration had got. What sort of contest, he couldn’t say “chess” because Draco wouldn’t be able to ac- cept without it looking strange, he couldn’t say “arm-wrestling” because Mr Goyle would crush him— “How about this?” Harry said loudly. “Gregory Goyle and I stand apart from each other, and no-one else is allowed to come near either of us. We don’t use our wands and neither does anyone else. I don’t move from where I’m standing, and neither does he. And if I can get my hands on Neville’s Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle relinquishes all claim to that Remembrall he’s holding and gives it to me.” There was another pause as people’s looks of relief transmuted to con- fusion. “Hah, Potter!” said Draco loudly. “I’d like to see you do that! Mr Goyle accepts!” “It’s on!” said Harry. “Potter, what?” whispered Draco, which he somehow did without mov- ing his lips. Harry didn’t know how to answer without moving his. People were putting their wands away, and Mr Goyle swooped grace- fully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs started over towards Mr Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately pleading look and they backed off. Harry walked toward Mr Goyle and stopped when he was a few paces away, far enough apart that they couldn’t reach each other. Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand. Everyone else backed away. Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he wanted to do, but it had to be done in such a way that no-one understood what he’d done— “All right,” Harry said loudly. “And now…” He took a deep breath and raised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps from anyone who’d heard about the pies, which was practically everyone. “I call upon the insanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp!” And Harry snapped his fingers. A lot of people flinched. And nothing happened. Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing, until… “Um,” someone said. “Is that it?” Harry looked at the boy who’d spoken. “Look in front of you. You see that patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on it?” “Um, yeah,” said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?). “Dig it up.” Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks. “Er, why?” said Dean something. “Just do it,” said Terry Boot in a weary voice. “No point asking why, trust me on this one.” Dean something knelt down and began to scoop away dirt. After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. “There’s nothing there,” Dean said. Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a trea- sure map that would lead to another treasure map that would lead to Neville’s Remembrall which he would put there after getting it back from Mr Goyle… Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn’t threaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much. “Thanks, Dean!” Harry said loudly. “Ernie, would you look around on the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville’s Remem- brall?” People looked even more confused. “Just do it,” said Terry Boot. “He’ll keep trying until something works, and the scary thing is that—” “Merlin!” gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville’s Remembrall. “It’s here! Right where he fell!” “What?” cried Mr Goyle. He looked down and saw… …that he was still holding Neville’s Remembrall. There was a rather long pause. “Er,” said Dean something, “that’s not possible, is it?” “It’s a plot hole,” said Harry. “I made myself weird enough to distract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had already picked up the Remembrall.” “No, wait, I mean, that’s totally not possible—” “Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying on broomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands on Neville’s Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has to relin- quish all claim to the Remembrall he’s holding and give it to me. Those were the terms, remember?” Harry stretched out a hand and beckoned Ernie. “Just roll it over here, since no-one’s supposed to get close to me, okay?” “Hold on!” shouted a Slytherin—Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn’t likely to forget that name. “How do we know that’s Neville’s Remembrall? You could’ve just dropped another Remembrall there—” “The Slytherin is strong with this one,” Harry said, smiling. “But you have my word that the one Ernie’s holding is Neville’s. No comment about the one Gregory Goyle’s holding.” Zabini spun to Draco. “Malfoy! You’re not just going to let him get away with that—” “Shut up, you,” rumbled Mr Crabbe, standing behind Draco. “Mr Mal- foy doesn’t need you to tell him what to do!” Good minion. “My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Mal- foy,” Harry said. “Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr Malfoy said he’d like to see me do, and as for the judgement of the bet, I leave that up to Mr Malfoy.” Harry inclined his head towards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow Draco to save enough face. There was a pause. “You promise that actually is Neville’s Remembrall?” Draco said. “Yes,” Harry said. “That’s the one that’ll go back to Neville and it was his originally. And the one Gregory Goyle’s holding goes to me.” Draco nodded, looking decisive. “I won’t question the word of the No- ble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all was. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word as well. Mr Goyle, give that to Mr Potter—” “Hey!” Zabini said. “He hasn’t won yet, he hasn’t got his hands on—” “Catch, Harry!” said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall. Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he’d always had good reflexes that way. “There,” said Harry, “I win…” Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped. The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like a miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad daylight. 232 LOCATING THE H YPOTHESIS 233 CH APTER 17 234 LOCATING THE H YPOTHESIS 235 CH APTER 17 Thursday. There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts. It was 5:32 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next to Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the Headmaster’s office. No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall’s office to the Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to report to Professor Flitwick’s office, and there Harry had learned that Dumbledore wanted to speak to him. Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick if the Headmaster had said what this was about. Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way. Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to in- voke the words of power and madness. Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp? Harry had thought but not said aloud. “Please don’t worry too much, Mr Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick from somewhere around Harry’s shoulder level. (Harry was grateful for Professor Flitwick’s gigantic puffy beard, it was hard getting used to a Pro- fessor who was not only shorter than him but spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) “Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a little odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never hurt a student in the slightest, and I don’t believe he ever will.” Professor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. “Just keep that in mind at all times and you’ll be sure not to panic!” This was not helping. “Good luck!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the gar- goyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at all. (Of course, the password wouldn’t be much good if you could hear someone saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a very natural and ordinary movement that Harry found rather shocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable stone the whole time. Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs. There was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more disturbing was that revolving the spiral ought not to take you anywhere. “Up you go!” squeaked Flitwick. Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found himself, for some reason that his brain couldn’t seem to visualise at all, moving upwards. The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral stairs kept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a rather dizzy- ing time, Harry found himself in front of an oak door with a brass griffin knocker. Harry reached out and turned the doorknob. The door swung open. And Harry saw the most interesting room he’d ever seen in his life. There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or slowly changed shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were dozens of mys- terious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers, all bubbling, boil- ing, oozing, changing colour, or forming into interesting shapes that van- ished half a second after you saw them. There were things that looked like clocks with many hands, inscribed with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand colours, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden cup filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon encrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of people sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a hat rack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk. Before the desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink pyjamas. Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad in- tensity. With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the desk. The door swung shut behind him with a loud thunk. “Hello, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Hello, Headmaster,” Harry replied. So they were on a first-name ba- sis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him— “Please, Harry!” said Dumbledore. “Headmaster sounds so formal. Just call me Heh for short.” “I’ll be sure to, Heh,” said Harry. There was a slight pause. “Do you know,” said Dumbledore, “you’re the first person who’s ever taken me up on that?” “Ah…” Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the sudden sink- ing feeling in his stomach. “I’m sorry, I, ah, Headmaster, you told me to do it so I did—” “Heh, please!” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “And there’s no call to be so worried, I won’t launch you out a window just because you make one mistake. I’ll give you plenty of warnings first, if you’re doing something wrong! Besides, what matters isn’t how people talk to you, it’s what they think of you.” He’s never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and you’ll be sure not to panic. Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open, show- ing some small yellow lumps. “Sherbet lemon?” said the Headmaster. “Er, no thank you, Heh,” said Harry. Does slipping a student LSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into the category of harmless fun? “You, um, said something about my being too young to invoke the words of power and madness?” “That you most certainly are!” Dumbledore said. “Thankfully the Words of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no-one has the slightest idea what they are any more. It was just a little remark.” “Ah…” Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging open. “Why did you call me here, then?” “Why?” Dumbledore repeated. “Ah, Harry, if I went around all day ask- ing why I do things, I’d never have time to get a single thing done! I’m quite a busy person, you know.” Harry nodded, smiling. “Yes, it was a very impressive list. Headmas- ter of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mug- wump of the International Confederation of Wizards. Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than six hours if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it’s pretty impressive if you’re doing all that on just thirty hours a day.” There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on smiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive, but once it had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately messing with him, some- thing within him absolutely refused to sit and take it like a defenceless lump. “I’m afraid Time doesn’t like being stretched out too much,” said Dum- bledore after the slight pause, “and yet we ourselves seem to be a little too large for it, and so it’s a constant struggle to fit our lives into Time.” “Indeed,” Harry said with grave solemnity. “That’s why it’s best to come to our points quickly.” For a moment Harry wondered if he’d gone too far. Then Dumbledore chuckled. “Straight to the point it shall be.” The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat and brushing his beard against his desk. “Harry, this Monday you did some- thing that should have been impossible even with a Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible with only a Time-Turner. Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?” A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He’d done that using the Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a Christmas box along with a note, and that note had said: If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he would never let it escape his grasp…. “A natural thought,” Dumbledore went on, “is that since none of the first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone else was present, and yet unseen. And if no-one could see them, why, it would be easy enough for them to throw the pies. One might further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far beyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak.” Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. “Am I on the right track so far, Harry?” Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would not at all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he couldn’t think of anything else to say. Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. “Don’t worry, Harry, you haven’t done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren’t against the rules—I sup- pose they’re rare enough that no-one ever got around to putting them on the list. But really I was wondering something else entirely.” “Oh?” Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage. Dumbledore’s eyes shone with enthusiasm. “You see, Harry, after you’ve been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of these things. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the world. You begin to harbour suspicions before the moment of revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an invisibility cloak made its way into your hands only four days after you discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for sale in Diagon Alley, but there is one which might find its own way to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder if by some strange chance you have found not just an invisibility cloak, but the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the gaze of Death himself.” Dumbledore’s gaze was bright and eager. “May I see it, Harry?” Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his system now and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful wizard in the world and there was no way he could make it out the door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did, he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down through the Potters for who knew how long— Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright light had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little sorrowful. “Harry,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t want to, you can just say no.” “I can?” Harry croaked. “Yes, Harry,” said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and wor- ried. “It seems that you’re afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what I’ve done to earn your distrust?” Harry swallowed. “Is there some way you can swear a binding magical oath that you won’t take my cloak?” Dumbledore shook his head slowly. “Unbreakable Vows are not to be used so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know the spell, you would have only my word that the spell was binding. Yet surely you realise that I do not need your permission to see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself, mokeskin pouch or no.” Dumbledore’s face was very grave. “But this I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from you. Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to show it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I need to prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there.” “Ah…” Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood of adrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off his belt. “If you really don’t need my permission…then you have it.” Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he was Obliviated afterwards. The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any word of retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility. “Ah,” breathed Dumbledore. “I was right…” He poured the shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. “Centuries old, and still as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our art over the years, and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no-one can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a song forever being sung without anyone to hear it…” The wizard looked up from the Cloak. “Do not sell it,” he said, “do not give it to anyone as a possession. Think twice before you show it to anyone, and ponder three times again before you reveal it is a Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing of Power.” For a moment Dumbledore’s face grew wistful… …and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry. Harry put it back in his pouch. Dumbledore’s face was grave once more. “May I ask again, Harry, how you came to distrust me so?” Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed. “There was a note with the Cloak,” Harry said in a small voice. “It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew. I don’t know who left the note, though, I really don’t.” “I…see,” Dumbledore said slowly. “Well, Harry, I won’t impugn the motives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they them- selves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give you the Cloak, after all.” Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore’s charity, and abashed at the sharp contrast with his own attitude. The old wizard went on. “But you and I are both game pieces of the same colour, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort, and the old man who held him off long enough for you to save the day. I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice and ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to distrust me.” “I’m sorry,” Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he’d just told off Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore’s kindness was only making him feel worse. “I shouldn’t have distrusted you.” “Alas, Harry, in this world…” The old wizard shook his head. “I cannot even say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in truth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to trust. Perhaps even some you call friends.” Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. “Like who?” Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of his instruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length. After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. “He probably seems to you quite charming,” said Dumbledore. “Polite—to you at least. Well- spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a helping hand, a favour, a word of advice—” “Oh, Draco Malfoy!” Harry said, feeling rather relieved that it wasn’t Hermione or something. “Oh no, no no no, you’ve got it all wrong, he’s not turning me, I’m turning him.” Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. “You’re what?” “I’m going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side,” Harry said. “You know, make him a good guy.” Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one of the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone, let alone someone with a long silver beard. “Are you certain,” said the old wizard after a moment, “that he is ready to be redeemed? I fear that what- ever goodness you think you see within him is only wishful thinking—or worse, a lure, a bait—” “Er, not likely,” Harry said. “I mean if he’s trying to disguise himself as a good guy he’s incredibly bad at it. This isn’t a question of Draco com- ing up to me and being all charming and me deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I selected him for redemption specif- ically because he’s the heir to House Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would obviously be him.” Dumbledore’s left eye twitched. “You intend to sow seeds of love and kindness in Draco Malfoy’s heart because you expect Malfoy’s heir to prove valuable to you?” “Not just to me!” Harry said indignantly. “To all of magical Britain, if this works out! And he’ll have a happier and mentally healthier life him- self! Look, I don’t have enough time to turn everyone away from the Dark Side and I’ve got to ask where the Light can gain the most advantage the fastest—” Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry would expect, almost howling. It seemed positively undignified. An an- cient and powerful wizard ought to chuckle in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was gasping for breath. Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while watching the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup, and that was how hard Dumbledore was laughing now. “It’s not that funny,” Harry said after a while. He was starting to worry about Dumbledore’s sanity again. Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort. “Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin laugh- ing at things that no-one else thinks is funny, because when you’re wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!” The old wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. “Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed.” Harry’s brain took a moment to place the familiar words…“Hey, that’s a Tolkien quote! Gandalf says that!” “Théoden, actually,” said Dumbledore. “You’re Muggle-born?” Harry said in shock. “I’m afraid not,” said Dumbledore, smiling again. “I was born seventy years before that book was published, dear child. But it seems that my Muggle-born students tend to think alike in certain ways. I have accumu- lated no fewer than twenty copies of The Lord of the Rings and three sets of Tolkien’s entire collected works, and I treasure every one of them.” Dum- bledore drew his wand and held it up and struck a pose. “You cannot pass! How does that look?” “Ah,” Harry said in something approaching complete brain shutdown, “I think you’re missing a Balrog.” And the pink pyjamas and squashed mushroom hat were not helping in the slightest. “I see.” Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his belt. “I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of late. Nowadays it’s all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try desperately to pre- vent any work from getting done, and formal dinners where foreign politi- cians compete to see who can be the most obstinate fool. And being myste- rious at people, knowing things I have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only be understood in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which powerful wizards amuse themselves after they have left the part of the pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speaking of which, Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something which belonged to your father.” “You do?” said Harry. “Gosh, who would have figured.” “Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore. “I suppose it is a little predictable, isn’t it?” His face turned solemn. “Nonetheless…” Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one of the drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and, straining slightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object out of the drawer, which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a huge thunk. “This,” Dumbledore said, “was your father’s rock.” Harry stared at it. It was light grey, discoloured, irregularly shaped, sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock. Dumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest available cross-section, but it still wobbled unstably on his desk. Harry looked up. “This is a joke, right?” “It is not,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very se- rious. “I took this from the ruins of James and Lily’s home in Godric’s Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from then until now, against the day when I could give it to you.” In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry’s model of the world, Dumbledore’s insanity was rapidly rising in probability. But there was still a substantial amount of probability allocated to other alternatives…“Um, is it a magical rock?” “Not so far as I know,” said Dumbledore. “But I advise you with the greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person at all times.” All right. Dumbledore was probably insane but if he wasn’t…well, it would be just too embarrassing to get in trouble from ignoring the advice of the inscrutable old wizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top 100 Obvious Failure Modes. Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to find some angle from which to lift it without cutting himself. “I’ll put it in my pouch, then.” Dumbledore frowned. “That may not be close enough to your person. And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?” “You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?” Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. “That might prove wise.” “Ah…” Harry said. It looked rather heavy. “I’d think the other students would tend to ask me questions about that.” “Tell them I ordered you to do it,” said Dumbledore. “No-one will ques- tion that, since they all think I’m insane.” His face was still perfectly seri- ous. “Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to carry large rocks I can kind of see why people would think that.” “Ah, Harry,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep of one hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments around the room. “When we are young we believe that we know everything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise that the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we ourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which appears to us as insanity.” “Reality is always lawful,” said Harry, “even if we don’t know the law.” “Precisely, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “To understand this—and I see that you do understand it—is the essence of wisdom.” “So…why do I have to carry this rock exactly?” “I can’t think of a reason, actually,” said Dumbledore. “…you can’t.” Dumbledore nodded. “But just because I can’t think of a reason doesn’t mean there is no reason.” The instruments ticked on. “Okay,” said Harry, “I’m not even sure if I should be saying this, but that is simply not the correct way to deal with our admitted ignorance of how the universe works.” “It isn’t?” said the old wizard, looking surprised and disappointed. Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work out in his favour, but he carried on regardless. “No. I don’t even know if that fal- lacy has an official name, but if I had to make one up myself, it would be ‘privileging the hypothesis’ or something like that. How can I put this for- mally…um…suppose you had a million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the time on boxes that didn’t have a diamond. If you ran twenty detectors over all the boxes, you’d have, on average, one false can- didate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true candidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible answers, most of the evi- dence you need goes into just locating the true hypothesis out of millions of possibilities—bringing it to your attention in the first place. The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three plausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just jump ahead without evi- dence and promote one particular possibility to the focus of your atten- tion, you’re skipping over most of the work. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people, and there’s a murder, and a detective says, well, we’ve got no evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass did it?” “Did he?” said Dumbledore. “No,” said Harry. “But later it turns out that the murderer had black hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone’s like, ah, looks like Mor- timer did it after all. So it’s unfair to Mortimer for the police to promote him to their attention without having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just locating the true answer—starting to pay attention to it. You don’t need proof, or the sort of official evidence that scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of hint, and that hint has to discriminate that particu- lar possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can’t just pluck the right answer out of thin air. You can’t even pluck a possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there’s got to be a million other things I could do besides carrying around my father’s rock. Just because I’m igno- rant about the universe doesn’t mean that I’m unsure about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with prob- abilities are no less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what you just did is not allowed.” Harry paused. “Unless, of course, you have some hint you’re not mentioning.” “Ah,” said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful. “An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn’t it break down at the point where you make an analogy between a million potential murderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out of many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father’s rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is wiser to do than not.” Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had ac- cessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside—at least his arm seemed to be moving. “I will remark,” Dumbledore said while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this completely unexpected rejoin- der, “that it is a common misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which is not at all the same quality as being intelligent.” The wizard was smiling as he bent over the drawer. “Nonetheless, you do seem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young hero and more like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may have been taking the wrong ap- proach with you, Harry, and that you may be able to understand things that few others could grasp. So I shall be daring, and offer you a certain other heirloom.” “You don’t mean…” gasped Harry. “My father…owned another rock?” “Excuse me,” said Dumbledore, “I am still older and more mysterious than you and if there are any revelations to be made then I will do the revealing, thank you…oh, where is that thing!” Dumbledore reached down further into the desk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and whole torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking out, as though the desk drawer was eating him. Harry couldn’t help but wonder just how much stuff was in there and what the complete inventory would look like. Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the objec- tive of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside the rock. It was a used, ragged-edged, textbook with a worn spine: Intermediate Potion Making by Libatius Borage. There was a picture of a smoking vial on the cover. “This,” Dumbledore intoned, “was your mother’s fifth-year Potions textbook.” “Which I am to carry with me at all times,” said Harry. “Which holds a terrible secret. A secret whose revelation could prove so disastrous that I must ask you to swear—and I do require you to swear it seriously, Harry, whatever you may think of all this—never to tell anyone or anything else.” Harry considered his mother’s fifth-year Potions textbook, which, ap- parently, held a terrible secret. The problem was that Harry did take that oaths like that very seriously. Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the right sort of person. And… “I’m feeling thirsty,” Harry said, “and that is not at all a good sign.” Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this cryptic statement. “Do you swear, Harry?” said Dumbledore. His eyes gazed intently into Harry’s. “Otherwise I cannot tell you.” “Yes,” said Harry. “I swear.” That was the trouble with being a Raven- claw. You couldn’t refuse an offer like that or your curiosity would eat you alive, and everyone else knew it. “And I swear in turn,” said Dumbledore, “that what I am about to tell you is the truth.” Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry leaned in to see. “Do you see these notes,” Dumbledore said in a voice so low it was al- most a whisper, “written in the margins of the book?” Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be describing something called a potion of eagle’s splendour, many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn’t recognise at all and whose names didn’t appear to derive from English. Scrawled in the margin was a handwritten annota- tion saying, I wonder what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of blueberries? and immediately beneath was a reply in different handwrit- ing, You’d get sick for weeks and maybe die. “I see them,” said Harry. “What about them?” Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. “The ones in this handwrit- ing,” he said, still in that low voice, “were written by your mother. And the ones in this handwriting,” moving his finger to indicate the first scrawl, “were written by me. I would turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm while she was sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they had the most amazing fights.” That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the Headmaster of Hogwarts was, in fact, crazy. Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. “Do you understand the implications of what I have just told you, Harry?” “Ehhh…” Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. “Sorry…I…not re- ally…” “Ah well,” said Dumbledore, and sighed. “I suppose your cleverness has limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I didn’t say anything?” Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. “Of course,” Harry said. “You know it’s actually getting rather late in the day and I’m a bit hungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really” and Harry made a beeline for the door. The doorknob entirely failed to turn. “You wound me, Harry,” said Dumbledore’s voice in quiet tones that were coming from right behind him. “Do you not at least realise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?” Harry slowly turned around. In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and wearing what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink pyjamas. Behind him was a door that didn’t seem to be working at the moment. Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted to lean on a wizard’s staff he didn’t have. “Really,” said Dumbledore, “you try anything new instead of following the same pattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all start running away.” The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. “I’d hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I’d heard that your own friends also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not believe the same of me?” “Please open the door,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “If you ever want me to trust you again, open the door.” There was the sound behind him of a door opening. “There were more things I planned to say to you,” Dumbledore said, “and if you leave now, you will not know what they were.” Sometimes Harry absolutely hated being a Ravenclaw. He’s never hurt a student, said Harry’s Gryffindor side. Just keep remember- ing that and you’ll be sure not to panic. You’re not going to run away just because things are getting interesting, are you? You can’t just walk out on the Headmaster! said the Hufflepuff part. What if he starts deducting House points? He could make your school life very difficult if he decides he doesn’t like you! And a piece of himself which Harry didn’t much like but couldn’t quite manage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of being one of the few friends of this mad old wizard who also happened to be Head- master, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than Draco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying things like poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk to, doesn’t he? and you wouldn’t want such a powerful man to end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you? and I wonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you if, you know, you became friends with him and even I bet he’s got a reaallly interesting book collection. You’re all a bunch of lunatics, Harry thought at the entire assemblage, but he’d been unanimously outvoted by every component part of himself. Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out, and deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements regardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore. When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane wiz- ard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good, maybe. “Please don’t do that again,” Harry said. “I don’t like being trapped.” “I am sorry about that, Harry,” said Dumbledore in what sounded like tones of sincere apology. “But it would have been terribly unwise to let you leave without your father’s rock.” “Of course,” Harry said. “It wasn’t reasonable of me to expect the door to open before I put the quest items in my inventory.” Dumbledore smiled and nodded. Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around to the front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave up the rock in his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in. He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the Widening Lip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was rather noisy and had a distinctly complaining sound to it. His mother’s fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret that was in fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after. And then Harry’s inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for ingrati- ating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had been per- fectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the majority Raven- claw faction. “So,” Harry said. “Um. As long as I’m hanging around, I don’t suppose you would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office? I’m a bit curious as to what some of these things are,” and that was his understatement for the month of September. Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin. “I’m flattered by your interest,” said Dumbledore, “but I’m afraid there isn’t much to say.” Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall and pointed to a painting of a sleeping man. “These are portraits of past Headmasters of Hogwarts.” He turned and pointed to his desk. “This is my desk.” He pointed to his chair. “This is my chair—” “Excuse me,” Harry said, “actually I was wondering about those.” Harry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering “blorple… blorple…blorple”. “Oh, the little fiddly things?” said Dumbledore. “They came with the Headmaster’s office and I have absolutely no idea what most of them do. Although this dial with the eight hands counts the number of, let’s call them sneezes, by left-handed witches within the borders of France, you would not believe how much work it took to nail that down. And this one with the golden wibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never, ever going to figure out what it’s doing.” Dumbledore took a step over to the hat rack while Harry was still pro- cessing this. “Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe the two of you have met. It told me that it was never again to be placed on your head under any circumstances. You’re only the fourteenth student in his- tory it’s said that about, Baba Yaga was another one and I’ll tell you about the other twelve when you’re older. This is an umbrella. This is another umbrella.” Dumbledore took another few steps and turned around, now smiling quite broadly. “And of course, most people who come to my office want to see Fawkes.” Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden platform. Harry came over, rather puzzled. “This is Fawkes?” “Fawkes is a phœnix,” said Dumbledore. “Very rare, very powerful magical creatures.” “Ah…” Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the tiny, beady black eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of power or intelligence. “Ahhh…” Harry said again. He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was pretty hard to miss. “Umm…” Say something intelligent! Harry’s mind roared at itself. Don’t just stand there sounding like a gibbering moron! Well what the heck am I supposed to say? Harry’s mind fired back. Anything! You mean, anything besides “Fawkes is a chicken”— Yes! Anything but that! “So, ah, what sort of magic do phœnixes do, then?” “Their tears have the power to heal,” Dumbledore said. “They are crea- tures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire may extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another. The tremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly, and yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in this world, for whenever their bod- ies fail them they immolate themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or sometimes an egg.” Dumbledore came closer and inspected the chicken, frowning. “Hm…looking a little peaky there, I’d say.” By the time this statement registered fully in Harry’s mind, the chicken was already on fire. The chicken’s beak opened, but it didn’t have time for so much as a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of burning. And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun, leaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden platform. “Don’t look so horrified, Harry!” said Dumbledore. “Fawkes hasn’t been hurt.” Dumbledore’s hand dipped into a pocket, and then the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small yellowish egg. “Look, here’s an egg!” “Oh…wow…amazing…” “But now we really should get on with things,” Dumbledore said. Leav- ing the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to his throne and seated himself. “It’s almost time for dinner, after all, and we wouldn’t want to have to use our Time-Turners.” There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of Harry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the Head- master of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken. “Yes, things,” said Harry’s lips. “And then dinner.” You’re sounding like a gibbering moron again observed Harry’s Internal Critic. “Well,” Dumbledore said. “I fear I have a confession to make, Harry. A confession and an apology.” “Apologies are good” that doesn’t even make sense! What am I talking about? The old wizard sighed deeply. “You may not still think so after under- standing what I have to say. I’m afraid, Harry, that I’ve been manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to the care of your wicked step-parents—” “My step-parents aren’t wicked!” blurted Harry. “My parents, I mean!” “They aren’t?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised and disappointed. “Not even a little wicked? That doesn’t fit the pattern…” Harry’s inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs, SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE’LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM! “No, no,” said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, “I was just trying to spare your feelings, they’re actually very wicked…” “They are?” Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently. “What do they do?” Talk fast “they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash problems and they don’t let me read a lot of books and—” “Ah, good, that’s good to hear,” said Dumbledore, leaning back again. He smiled in a sad sort of way. “I apologise for that, then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. I’m sorry to say, Harry, that I am responsible for virtually ev- erything bad that has ever happened to you. I know that this will probably make you very angry.” “Yes, I’m very angry!” said Harry. “Grrr!” Harry’s Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award for the Worst Acting in the History of Ever. “And I just wanted you to know,” Dumbledore said, “I wanted to tell you as early as possible, in case something happens to one of us later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has already happened, and everything that will.” Moisture glistened in the old wizard’s eyes. “And I’m very angry!” said Harry. “So angry that I want to leave right now unless you’ve got anything else to say!” Just go before he sets you on fire! shrieked Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Gryf- findor. “I understand,” said Dumbledore. “One last thing then, Harry. You are not to attempt the forbidden door on the third-floor corridor. There’s no possible way you could get through all the traps, and I wouldn’t want to hear that you’d been hurt trying. Why, I doubt that you could so much as open the first door, since it’s locked and you don’t know the spell Alohomora—” Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the doorknob turned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down the spiral stairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling over themselves, in just a moment he was at the bottom and the gargoyle was walking aside and Harry fired out of the stairwell like a cannonball. 255 CH APTER 17 256 LOCATING THE H YPOTHESIS 257 259 CH APTER 18 260 DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted, annoyed, and infuriated all at once. “Dungeons!” Harry hissed. “Dungeons! These are not dungeons! This is a basement! A basement!” Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were all used to him by now. It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was located was called the “dungeons” for no better reason than that it was below ground and slightly colder than the main castle. In Hogwarts! In Hogwarts! Harry had been waiting his whole life and now he was still waiting and if there was anywhere on the face of the Earth that had decent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going to have to build his own castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless abyss? A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and Harry cheered up considerably. The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating in huge jars on shelves that covered every centimetre of wall space between the cupboards. Harry was far enough along in his reading now that he could actually identify some of the creatures, like the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimetre spider looked like an Acromantula but it was too small to be one. He’d tried asking Hermione, but she hadn’t seemed very interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing. Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when the as- sassin swept into the room. That was the first thought that crossed Harry’s mind when he saw Pro- fessor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about the way the man stalked between the children’s desks. His robes were un- kempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something about him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of them looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the impression that where Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man would simply kill you. “Sit down,” said Professor Severus Snape. “Now.” Harry and a few other children who had been standing around talk- ing to each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on ending up next to Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting down in the near- est empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it was a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two desks to the left of Hermi- one. Severus seated himself behind the teacher’s desk, and without the slightest transition or introduction, said, “Hannah Abbott.” “Here,” said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice. “Susan Bones.” “Present.” And so it went, no-one daring to say a word in edgewise, until: “Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new…celebrity.” “The celebrity is present, sir.” Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly looked like they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was still there. Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the next name on his list. Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him to do anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn’t like him, for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it, better by far that this Potions professor should pick on him rather than, say, Neville or Hermi- one. Harry was a lot better able to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best. When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over the full class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without stars. “You are here,” Severus said in a quiet voice which the students at back strained to hear, “to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion mak- ing. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins,” this in a rather caress- ing, gloating tone, “bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses,” this was just getting creepier and creepier. “I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren’t as great a pack of fools as I usually have to teach.” Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on Harry’s face, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry was sitting. “Potter!” snapped the Potions professor. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” Harry blinked. “Was that in Magical Drafts and Potions?” he said. “I just finished reading it, and I don’t remember anything which used wormwood—” Hermione’s hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused her to raise her hand even higher. “Tut, tut,” Severus said silkily. “Fame clearly isn’t everything.” “Really?” Harry said. “But you just told us you’d teach us how to bot- tle fame. Say, how does that work, exactly? You drink it and turn into a celebrity?” Three-quarters of the class flinched. Hermione’s hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn’t surprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn’t the sort of girl who would play along after it became clear that the professor was deliberately trying to humiliate him. Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first rejoinder that had crossed his mind was ‘Abracadabra’. “Let’s try again,” said Severus. “Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” “That’s not in the textbook either,” Harry said, “but in one Muggle book I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified hair found in a human stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would cure any poison—” “Wrong,” Severus said. “A bezoar is found in the stomach of a goat, it is not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not all.” “I didn’t say it would, I said that was what I read in one Muggle book—” “No-one here is interested in your pathetic Muggle books. Final try. What is the difference, Potter, between monksblood and wolfsbane?” That did it. “You know,” Harry said icily, “in one of my quite fascinating Muggle books, they describe a study in which people managed to make them- selves look very smart by asking questions about random facts that only they knew. Apparently the onlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers didn’t, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying game. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the outermost orbital of a carbon atom?” Severus’s smile widened. “Four,” he said. “It is a useless fact which no-one should bother writing down, however. And for your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. Thought you didn’t need to open the book before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should be copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him.” Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. “And that will be…five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.” Hermione gasped, along with a number of others. “Professor Severus Snape,” Harry bit out. “I know of nothing which I have done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you have with me which I do not know about, I suggest we—” “Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of you, open your books to page 3.” There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in the back of Harry’s throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If crying was not an effective strategy for destroying this Potions professor then there was no point in crying. Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have been drained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he’d been trying to keep his temper but he couldn’t seem to remember why. “Harry,” whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over, “stop, please, it’s all right, we won’t count it—” “Talking in class, Granger? Three—” “So,” said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, “how does one go about fil- ing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does one talk to the Deputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of Governors…would you care to explain how it works?” The class was utterly frozen. “Detention for one month, Potter,” Severus said, smiling even more broadly. “I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will not serve any detention you give.” People stopped breathing. Severus’s smile vanished. “Then you will be—” his voice stopped short. “Expelled, were you about to say?” Harry, on the other hand, was now smiling thinly. “But then you seemed to doubt your ability to carry out the threat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on the other hand, neither doubt nor fear the prospect of finding a school with less abusive profes- sors. Or perhaps I should hire private tutors, as is my accustomed prac- tice, and be taught at my full learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something about bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there are teachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be easier if I find some way to get rid of you instead.” “Get rid of me?” Severus said, now also smiling thinly. “What an amus- ing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?” “I understand there have been a number of complaints about you from students and their parents,” a guess but a safe one, “which leaves only the question of why you’re not already gone. Is Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions professor? I could chip in, if so. I’m sure they could find a better class of teacher if they offered double your current salary.” Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the classroom. “You will find,” Severus said softly, “that the Board of Governors is not the slightest bit sympathetic to your offer.” “Lucius…” Harry said. “That’s why you’re still here. Perhaps I should chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires to meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?” Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the corner of his eye, but his attention was all on Severus. “You are a very foolish boy,” Severus said. He wasn’t smiling at all, now. “You have nothing that Lucius values more than my friendship. And if you did, I have other allies.” His voice grew hard. “And I find it increasingly unlikely that you were not Sorted into Slytherin. How was it that you man- aged to stay out of my House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was joking. For the first time in recorded history. What were you really chatting about with the Sorting Hat, Potter? Did you have something that it wanted?” Harry stared into Severus’s cold gaze and remembered that the Sort- ing Hat had warned him not to meet anyone’s eyes while thinking about— Harry dropped his gaze to Severus’s desk. “You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!” A shock of sudden understanding—“So it was you the Sorting Hat was warning me about!” “What?” said Severus’s voice, sounding genuinely surprised, though of course Harry didn’t look at his face. Harry got up out of his desk. “Sit down, Potter,” said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn’t looking. Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. “I have no inten- tion of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at Hogwarts,” Harry said with deadly calm. “I think I’ll take my leave of this class, and either hire a tutor to teach me Potions while I’m here, or if the Board is really that locked up, learn over the summer. If any of you decide that you don’t care to be bullied by this man, my sessions will be open to you.” “Sit down, Potter!” Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob. It didn’t turn. Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus smiling nastily before he remembered to look away. “Open this door.” “No,” said Severus. “You are making me feel threatened,” said a voice so icy it didn’t sound like Harry’s at all, “and that is a mistake.” Severus’s voice laughed. “What do you intend to do about it, little boy?” Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he was standing near the back row of desks. Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one ter- rible motion, fingers poised to snap. Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank back or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves. “Harry don’t!” shrieked Hermione. “Whatever you were going to do to him, don’t do it!” “Have you all gone mad?” barked Severus’s voice. Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. “I wasn’t going to hurt him, Hermi- one,” Harry said, his voice a little lower. “I was just going to blow up the door.” Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren’t supposed to Transfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going back in time afterwards and getting Fred or George to Transfigure some care- fully measured amount of explosives might not actually have been such a good idea… “Silencio,” said Severus’s voice. Harry tried to say “What?” and found that no sound was coming out. “This has become ridiculous. I think you’ve been allowed to get your- self in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most disruptive and unruly student I have ever seen, and I don’t recall how many points Ravenclaw has right now, but I’m sure I can manage to wipe them all out. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw! Now sit down and watch the rest of the class take their lesson!” Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say ‘marker’ but of course no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him; and then it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger motions, which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry strode over to an empty desk, not the one he’d originally sat down in, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of paper, put away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker access, and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of the class. I’M LEAVING DOES ANYONE ELSE NEED TO GET OUT? “You’re insane, Potter,” Severus said with cold contempt. Aside from that, no-one spoke. Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher’s desk, walked over to the wall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a cupboard door, stepped in, and slammed the door shut behind him. There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and then nothing. In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement and fear. The Potions Master’s face was now completely enraged. He crossed the room in terrible strides and yanked open the cupboard door. The cupboard was empty. 269 CH APTER 18 Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster’s office. Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in four layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before him, op- posite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them was an empty wooden stool. They were waiting for Harry Potter. Harry, Minerva thought despairingly, you promised you wouldn’t bite any teachers! And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry’s angry face and his outraged response: I said I wouldn’t bite anyone who didn’t bite me first! There was a knock at the door. “Come in!” Dumbledore called. The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in control of himself. “Good mor—” Harry’s voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped. Minerva tracked Harry’s gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring at Fawkes where the phœnix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy. Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore. Dumbledore winked at him. Minerva felt she was missing something. Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry’s face. His coolness wavered. Fear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm again. A chill went down Minerva’s spine. Something was not right here. “Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. His face was now serious once more. Harry sat. “So, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I’ve heard one report of this day from Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in your own words?” Harry’s gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. “It’s not complicated,” said the boy, smiling thinly. “He tried bullying me the way he’s been bul- lying every non-Slytherin in the school since the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I request a private conversation with you concerning them. A student who is reporting abusive behaviour from a professor can hardly be expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after all.” This time Minerva couldn’t stop herself from gasping out loud. Severus simply laughed. And the Headmaster’s face grew grave. “Mr Potter,” the Headmaster said, “one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in such terms. I fear that you labour under a terrible misapprehension. Professor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy’s.” There was silence for a few moments. When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. “Am I missing something here?” “Quite a number of things, Mr Potter,” said the Headmaster. “You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this meeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this morning.” “This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to students and collected stories to make sure there would be enough for a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of the younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when I heard them! You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this to your students? Why?” Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She’d—thought that, some- times, but somehow she’d never quite— “Mr Potter,” said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, “this meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your disregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and I have agreed, that three full months of detention will be appropriate—” “Declined,” Harry said icily. Minerva was speechless. “This is not a request, Mr Potter,” the Headmaster said. The full, entire force of the wizard’s gaze was turned on the boy. “This is your punishme—” “You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the children placed in your care, and if your explanation is not sufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with you as the target.” Minerva’s body swayed with the force of that blow, with the sheer raw lèse majesté. Even Severus looked shocked. “That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise,” Dumbledore said slowly. “I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the game board. For you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did not think that was your chosen side.” The boy was still for a long moment. “This conversation grows private,” Harry said. His hand flicked in Se- verus’s direction. “Send him away.” Dumbledore shook his head. “Harry, did I not tell you that Severus Snape has my fullest confidence?” The boy’s face showed the shock of it. “This man’s bullying makes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a newspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing this?” Dumbledore sighed. “I’m sorry, Harry. It has to do with things that you are not, at this time, ready to hear.” The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus. Then back to Dumbledore again. “It is insanity,” the boy said slowly. “You haven’t reined him in because you think he’s part of the pattern. That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Mas- ter to be a proper magical school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History.” “That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn’t it?” said Dumbledore, smiling. “Unacceptable,” Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and dark. “I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many possible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it simple. Either this man goes, or I do.” Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus’s eyes. Now Dumbledore’s gaze was also growing cold. “Expulsion, Mr Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It is not custom- arily used as a threat by students against the Headmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world, and an education here is not an oppor- tunity given to everyone. Are you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without you?” And Harry sat there, smiling thinly. Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn’t— “You forget,” Harry said, “that you’re not the only one who can see pat- terns. This grows private. Now send him—” Harry flicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence and mid-gesture. Minerva could see it on Harry’s face, the moment when he remem- bered. She’d told him, after all. “Mr Potter,” said the Headmaster, “once again, Severus Snape has my fullest confidence.” “You told him,” whispered the boy. “You utter fool.” Dumbledore didn’t react to the insult. “Told him what?” “That the Dark Lord is alive.” “What in Merlin’s name are you on about, Potter?” cried Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage. Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. “Oh, so we are a Slythe- rin, then,” Harry said. “I was starting to wonder.” And then there was silence. Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. “Harry, what are you talking about?” “I’m sorry, Albus,” Minerva whispered. Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her. “Professor McGonagall didn’t tell me,” said Harry’s voice, swiftly and less calm than it had been. “I guessed. I told you, I can see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her reaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of perfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine.” “And I told him,” said Minerva, her voice trembling a little, “that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew.” “Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going around asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn’t talk,” Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. “I really should have got one of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn’t have worked, but would have been worth a shot.” The boy smiled again. “Threat’s still on the table and I do expect to be briefed fully at some point.” Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised her chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved. Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as cold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his brother died. “And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do not comply with your wishes.” Harry’s voice was razor-sharp. “I regret to inform you that you are not the centre of the universe. I’m not threatening to walk out on magical Britain. I’m threatening to walk out on you. I am not a meek little Frodo. This is my quest and if you want in you will play by my rules.” Dumbledore’s face was still cold. “I am beginning to doubt your suit- ability as the hero, Mr Potter.” Harry’s return gaze was equally icy. “I am beginning to doubt your suitability as my Gandalf, Mr Dumbledore. Boromir was at least a plausible mistake. What is this Nazgûl doing in my Fellowship?” Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he was following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face away from Harry’s field of vision and was smiling. “I suppose,” Dumbledore said slowly, “that from your perspective it is a reasonable question. So, Mr Potter, if Professor Snape is to leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this issue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new demand?” “Leave me alone?” Harry’s voice was outraged. “I am not his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! Have you forgotten how defenceless chil- dren are? How much they hurt? Henceforth Severus will treat every student of Hogwarts with appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!” Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous laugh- ter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of him. Minerva didn’t dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that Severus was equally motionless. Harry’s visage grew even colder. “You mistake me, Headmaster, if you think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your punishment.” “Mr Potter—” Minerva said. She didn’t even know what she was going to say. She simply couldn’t let that go by. Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to Dum- bledore. “And if that seems impolite to you,” Harry said, his voice now a little less hard, “it seemed no less impolite when you said it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you considered a real human be- ing instead of a subordinate child, and I will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me—” “Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there was one! Of course you’re in here blackmailing me to save your fellow students, not to save yourself! I can’t imagine why I would have thought otherwise!” Dumbledore was now laughing even harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times. Harry’s gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her, addressing her for the first time. “Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice seemed to be wavering. “Does he need to take his medication or something?” “Ah…” Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say. “Well,” said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in his eyes. “Pardon me. I’m sorry for the interruption. Please continue with the blackmail.” Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a little unsteady. “Ah…he’s also to stop reading students’ minds.” “Minerva,” Severus said, his voice deadly, “you—” “Sorting Hat warned me,” said Harry. “What?” “Can’t say anything else. Anyway I think that’s it. I’m done.” Silence. “Now what?” Minerva said, when it became apparent that no-one else was going to say anything. “Now what?” Dumbledore echoed. “Why, now the hero wins, of course.” “What?” said Severus, Minerva, and Harry. “Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,” Dumbledore said, smiling happily. “But Hogwarts does need an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn’t be a proper magical school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful toward students in their fifth year and higher?” “What?” said all three of them again. “If it’s the most vulnerable victims about whom you’re concerned. Maybe you’re right, Harry. Maybe I have forgotten over the decades what it’s like to be a child. So let’s compromise. Severus will continue to un- fairly award points to Slytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To others he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only read minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will have its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as you put it, will be safe.” Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she’d ever been in her life. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left completely neu- tral, as though he couldn’t decide what sort of expression he ought to be wearing. “I suppose that is acceptable,” Harry said. His voice sounded a bit odd. “You can’t be serious,” Severus said, his voice as expressionless as his face. “I am very much in favour of this,” Minerva said slowly. She was so much in favour that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her robes. “But what could we possibly tell the students? They might not have ques- tioned this while Severus was…being awful to everyone, but—” “Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible secret of Severus’s and did a bit of blackmail,” said Dumbledore. “It’s true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading minds, and he certainly did blackmail us.” “This is insanity!” exploded Severus. “Bwah ha ha!” said Dumbledore. “Ah…” said Harry uncertainly. “And if anyone asks me why fifth-years and above got shafted? I wouldn’t blame them for being irate, and that part wasn’t exactly my idea—” “Tell them,” said Dumbledore, “that it wasn’t you who suggested the compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to say anything more. That, too, is true. There’s an art to it, you’ll pick it up with practice.” Harry nodded slowly. “And the points he took from Ravenclaw?” “They must not be given back.” It was Minerva who said it. Harry looked at her. “I’m sorry, Mr Potter,” she said. She was sorry, but it had to be done. “There must be some consequences for your misbehaviour or this school will fall to pieces.” Harry shrugged. “Acceptable,” he said flatly. “But in the future Seve- rus will not strike at my House connections by taking points from me, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should he feel that my behaviour requires correction, he may communicate his concerns to Professor McGonagall.” “Harry,” Minerva said, “will you continue to submit to school disci- pline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus was?” Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly be- fore it was quashed. “I will continue to be an ordinary student to every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided that they do not come under pressure from others who are.” Harry glanced briefly at Se- verus, then turned back to Dumbledore. “Leave Minerva alone, and I’ll be a regular Hogwarts student in her presence. No special privileges or immunities.” “Beautiful,” Dumbledore said sincerely. “Spoken like a true hero.” “And,” she said, “Mr Potter must publicly apologize for his actions of today.” Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical. “The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your actions, Mr Potter,” Minerva said. “It must be restored.” “I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably overestimate the importance of what you call school discipline, as compared to hav- ing History taught by a live teacher or not torturing your students. Main- taining the current status hierarchy and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if required. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I will leave it at that.” Minerva shook her head. “Mr Potter, you underestimate the impor- tance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself—” She paused. That hadn’t come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore, and even Harry were giving her strange looks. “To learn, I mean. Not every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is the other children who will be hurt, Mr Potter, if they see your example as one to be followed.” Harry’s lips curved into a twisted smile. “The first and last resort is the truth. The truth is that I shouldn’t have got angry, I shouldn’t have disrupted the class, I shouldn’t have done what I did, and I set a bad exam- ple for everyone. The truth is also that Severus Snape behaved in a fashion unbecoming a Hogwarts professor, and that from now on he will be more mindful of the injured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The two of us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with that.” “In your dreams, Potter!” spat Severus. “After all,” said Harry, smiling grimly, “if the students see that rules are for everyone…for professors too, not just for poor helpless students who get nothing but suffering out of the system…why, the positive effects on school discipline should be tremendous.” There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. “Minerva is thinking that you’re righter than you have any right to be.” Harry’s gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor. “Are you reading her mind?” “Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency,” said Dumbledore. “I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no apology will be required from you unless he apologizes as well. And now I declare this matter con- cluded, at least until lunchtime.” He paused. “Although, Harry, I’m afraid that Minerva wished to speak with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of any pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?” Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much adrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast. “Fawkes,” said Dumbledore, “accompany her, please.” “I don’t—” she started to say. Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent. The phœnix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame leaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth through her robes, all through her body. “Please follow me, Mr Potter,” she said, firmly now, and they left through the door. 280 DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES 281 CH APTER 18 282 DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES 283 CH APTER 18 Fifteen minutes into lunch hour. No-one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were shoot- ing him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the youngest stu- dents even had looks of admiration, but no-one was talking to him. Even Hermione hadn’t tried to come over. Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn’t said anything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told them that he would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They had nodded and quickly walked away. It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry’s face that was doing it. The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay. They knew, because they’d seen Flitwick come and get him, that he’d been called to the Headmaster’s office. Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would start laughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn’t stop until the nice people in white jackets came to haul him away. It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone over to the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in retrospect insane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that might have been real and might have been a pure whim of a crazy Headmaster, his dark side had protected his friends. He just couldn’t handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him again. He needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to recover but that wasn’t an option any more and the loss was like a hole in his existence but he couldn’t think about that because then he might start laughing. Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had ar- rived, almost none had departed. The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall. “If I may have your attention please,” Dumbledore said. “Harry Potter has something he would like to share with us.” Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head Table, with every eye staring at him. Harry turned and looked out at the four tables. It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept his face expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized speech. “The truth is sacred,” Harry said tonelessly. “One of my most treasured possessions is a button which reads ‘Speak the truth, even if your voice trembles’. This, then, is the truth. Remember that. I am not saying it be- cause I am being forced to say it, I am saying it because it is true. What I did in Professor Snape’s class was foolish, stupid, childish, and an inex- cusable violation of the rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my fellow students of their irreplaceable learning time. All be- cause I failed to control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever follow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it again.” Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy looks upon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking the loss of a fallen champion. At the younger parts of the Gryffindor table the look was almost universal. Until Harry raised his hand. He did not raise it high. That might have appeared peremptory. He certainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised his hand to chest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture that was seen more than heard. It was possible that most of the Head Table wouldn’t see it at all. This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the younger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from Slytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others. Harry kept his face expressionless. “Thank you,” he said. “That’s all.” “Thank you, Mr Potter,” said the Headmaster. “And now Professor Snape has something to share with us as well.” Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. “It has been brought to my attention,” he said, “that my own actions played a part in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr Potter, and in the ensuing discussion I realized that I had forgotten how easily injured are the feelings of the young and immature—” There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at the same time. Severus continued as if he had not heard. “The Potions classroom is a dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is necessary, but henceforth I will be more aware of the…emotional fragility…of students in their fourth year and younger. My deduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I will revoke Mr Potter’s detention. Thank you.” There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and faster than lightning Severus’s wand was in his hand and “Quietus!” silenced the offender. “I will still demand discipline and respect in all my classes,” Severus said coldly, “and anyone who trifles with me will regret it.” He sat down. “Thank you too!” Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. “Carry on!” And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat in Ravenclaw. There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly identi- fiable in the beginning. The first was an initial “What—” beginning many different sentences such as “What just happened—” and “What the hell—” The second was “Scourgify!” as students cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out drinks from themselves, the tablecloth, and each other. Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout. At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one unlit can- dles, Fred whispered, “I think we may be out of our league here, George.” And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell any- one, it would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry Potter could make absolutely anything happen by snapping his fingers. CHAPTER NINETEEN DELAYE D GRATIFICATION Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed robes somehow looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned- out than the same exact robes as worn by the two boys behind him. “Talk,” said Draco. “Yeah! Talk!” “You heard da boss! Talk!” “You two, on the other hand, shut up.” The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in that vast auditorium where all four Houses learned Defence, er, Battle Magic. The last session of classes on Friday. Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and that the brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was perhaps not the best time to single out Harry for anything. Harry had recovered a little, but… …but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of stress relief first. Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great solemnity upon Draco and his minions. “You ask, what is our aim?” Harry declaimed. “I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs—Victory in spite of all terrors— Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no—” “Talk about Snape,” Draco hissed. “What did you do?” Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more serious look. “You saw it,” Harry said. “Everyone saw it. I snapped my fingers.” “Harry! Stop teasing me!” So he’d been promoted to Harry now. Interesting. And in fact Harry was fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and feel bad if he didn’t respond somehow… Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the minions. “They won’t talk,” said Draco. “Draco,” Harry said, “I’m going to be one hundred percent honest here and say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with Mr Goyle’s cunning.” Mr Goyle winced. “Me neither,” said Draco. “I explained to him that I ended up owing you a favour because of it.” (Mr Goyle winced again.) “But there is a big difference between that sort of mistake and being indiscreet. That really is something they’ve been trained from childhood to understand.” “All right then,” Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though the background noises had gone to blurs in Draco’s presence. “I deduced one of Severus’s secrets and did a bit of blackmail.” Draco’s expression hardened. “Good, now tell me something you didn’t tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor, meaning that was the story you wanted to get all over the school.” Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught it. “What is Severus saying?” Harry said. “That he hadn’t realized how sensitive the feelings of young children were,” Draco said. “Even in Slytherin! Even to me!” “Are you sure,” Harry said, “that you want to know something your Head of House would rather you not know?” “Yes,” Draco said without hesitation. Interesting. “Then you really are going to send your minions away first, because I’m not sure I can believe everything you believe about them.” Draco nodded. “Okay.” Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle looked very unhappy. “Boss…” said Mr Crabbe. “You’ve given Mr Potter no reason to trust you,” Draco said. “Go!” They left. “In particular,” Harry said, lowering his voice even further, “I’m not entirely sure that they wouldn’t just report what I said to Lucius.” “Father wouldn’t do that!” Draco said, looking genuinely aghast. “They’re mine!” “I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said. “I’m just not sure I can believe every- thing you believe about your father. Imagine it was your secret and me telling you my father wouldn’t do that.” Draco nodded slowly. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Harry. It was wrong of me to ask it of you.” How did I get this promoted? Shouldn’t he hate me now? Harry had the feeling he was looking at something exploitable…he just wished his brain wasn’t so exhausted. Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at some complicated plotting. “Anyway,” Harry said. “Trade. I tell you a fact that isn’t on the grapevine, and does not go on the grapevine, and in particular does not go to your father, and in return you tell me what you and Slytherin think about the whole business.” “Deal!” Now to make this as vague as possible…something that wouldn’t hurt much even if it did get out…“What I said was true. I did discover one of Severus’s secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But Severus wasn’t the only person involved.” “I knew it!” Draco said exultantly. Harry’s stomach sank. He had apparently said something very signif- icant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign. “All right,” Draco said. He was grinning widely now. “So here’s what the reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were like, ‘We hate Harry Potter! Let’s go beat him up!’” Harry choked. “What is wrong with the Sorting Hat? That’s not Slythe- rin, it’s Gryffindor—” “Not all children are prodigies,” Draco said, though he was smiling in a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest that he pri- vately agreed with Harry’s opinion. “And it took around fifteen seconds for someone to explain to them why this might not be such a favour to Snape, so you’re fine. Anyway, after that was the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, ‘Looks like Harry Potter was just another do- gooder after all.’” “And then?” Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why that was stupid. “And then the actual smart people started talking. It’s obvious that you found a way to put a lot of pressure on Snape. And while that could be more than one thing…the obvious next thought is that it has something to do with Snape’s unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?” “No comment,” Harry said. At least his brain was processing this part correctly. House Slytherin had wondered why Severus wasn’t getting fired. And they’d concluded that Severus was blackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually be true…? But Dumbledore hadn’t seemed to act like it… Draco went on talking. “And the next thing the smart people pointed out was that if you could put enough pressure on Snape to make him leave half of Hogwarts alone, that meant you probably had enough power to get rid of him entirely, if you wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same way he tried to humiliate you—but you left us our Head of House.” Harry made his smile wider. “And then the really smart people,” Draco said, his face now serious, “went off and had a little discussion by themselves, and someone pointed out that it would be a very stupid thing to leave an enemy around like that. If you could break his hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it. Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him killed, he’d be very grateful to you, and you wouldn’t have to worry about Snape sneaking into your dorm at night with interesting potions.” Harry’s face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he really, really should have. “And from this you concluded…?” “Snape’s hold was some secret of Dumbledore’s and you’ve got the se- cret!” Draco was looking exultant. “It can’t be powerful enough to destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have used it by now. Snape refuses to use his hold for anything except staying king of Slytherin House in Hog- warts, and he doesn’t always get what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it’s got to be really good! Father’s been trying to get Snape to tell him for years!” “And,” Harry said, “now Lucius thinks maybe I can tell him. Did you already get an owl—” “I will tonight,” Draco said, and laughed. “It will say,” his voice took on a different, more formal cadence, “My beloved son: I’ve already told you of Harry Potter’s potential importance. As you have already realized, his impor- tance has now become greater and more urgent. If you see any possible avenue of friendship or point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.” Gosh. “Well,” Harry said, “not commenting on whether or not your whole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that we are not quite such good friends as yet.” “I know,” Draco said. Then his face turned very serious, and his voice grew quiet even within the blur. “Harry, has it occurred to you that if you know something Dumbledore doesn’t want known, Dumbledore might simply have you killed? And it would turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a po- tential competing leader into a valuable martyr, too.” “No comment,” Harry said yet again. He hadn’t thought of that last part, either. Didn’t seem to be Dumbledore’s style…but… “Harry,” Draco said, “you’ve obviously got incredible talent, but you’ve got no training and no mentors and you do stupid things sometimes and you really need an advisor who knows how to do this or you’re going to get hurt!” Draco’s face was fierce. “Ah,” Harry said. “An advisor like Lucius?” “Like me!” said Draco. “I’ll promise to keep your secrets from Father, from everyone, I’ll just help you figure out whatever you want to do!” Wow. Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the doors. “Class is about to start,” said Harry. “I’ll think about what you said, there’s lots of times I do wish I had all your training, it’s just I don’t know how I can trust you so quickly—” “You shouldn’t,” Draco said, “it’s too soon. See? I’ll give you good ad- vice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe hurry up and become closer friends.” “I’m open to that,” said Harry, who was already trying to figure out how to exploit it. “Another bit of advice,” Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell slouched to- ward his desk, “right now everyone in Slytherin’s wondering about you, so if you’re courting us, which I think you are, you should do something that signals friendship to Slytherin. Soon, like today or tomorrow.” “Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin wasn’t enough?” No reason Harry couldn’t take credit for it. Draco’s eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly, “It’s not the same, trust me, it’s got to be something obvious. Push your mudblood rival Granger into a wall or something, everyone in Slytherin will know what that means—” “That is not how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you have to push someone into a wall it means your brain is too weak to beat them the right way and everyone in Ravenclaw knows that—” The screen on Harry’s desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash of nostalgia for television and computers. “Ahem,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice, seeming to speak personally to Harry out of the screen. “Please take your seats.” 292 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 293 CH APTER 19 294 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 295 CH APTER 19 296 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 297 CH APTER 19 298 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 299 CH APTER 19 300 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 301 CH APTER 19 Yes, Professor Quirrell had said, it must be in front of everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where Snape confronted you and that is where you must learn to lose. So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence, and with requests from both Harry and the professor not to intervene. Hermione had her face turned away, but she hadn’t spoken out or even given him any sort of significant look, maybe because she’d been there in Potions too. Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a Muggle dojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor for when Harry was pushed down. Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell was right about his intent to kill… Harry’s wand lay on Professor Quirrell’s desk, not because Harry knew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry thought) he might have tried to jam it through someone’s eye socket. His pouch lay there, now containing his protected but still potentially fragile Time- Turner. Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him some boxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell had given him a look of silent understanding, and refused. I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in Hogwarts, I’ll be arrested, Harry chanted to him- self, trying to hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it would stay there if his intent to kill took over. Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins of dif- ferent years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he’d hit with a pie. Two others from that confrontation were also present. The one who’d said to stop, that they really shouldn’t do this, was missing. “I repeat,” Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern, “Potter is not to be really hurt. Any and all accidents will be treated as deliberate. Do you understand?” The older Slytherins nodded, grinning. “Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few pegs,” Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the first-years un- derstood. By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front of the group. “Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, “meet Mr Peregrine Derrick. He is better than you and he is about to show you that.” Derrick strode forward and Harry’s brain screamed discordantly, he must not run away, he must not fight back— Derrick stopped an arm’s length away from Harry. Harry wasn’t angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he beheld a teenage boy fully half a metre taller than himself, with clearly defined muscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible anticipation. “Ask him not to hurt you,” Professor Quirrell said. “Perhaps if he sees that you’re pathetic enough, he’ll decide that you’re boring, and go away.” There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins. “Please,” Harry said, his voice faltering, “don’t, hurt, me…” “That didn’t sound very sincere,” said Professor Quirrell. Derrick’s smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very supe- rior and… …Harry’s blood temperature was dropping… “Please don’t hurt me,” Harry tried again. Professor Quirrell shook his head. “How in Merlin’s name did you manage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one response you can possibly expect from Mr Derrick.” Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry. Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop himself, straightened up icily. “Wrong,” said Professor Quirrell, “wrong, wrong, wrong.” “You bumped into me, Potter,” Derrick said. “Apologize.” “I’m sorry!” “You don’t sound sorry,” said Derrick. Harry’s eyes widened in indignation, he had managed to make that sound pleading— Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands and knees. The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry’s vision, not far away. He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell’s real motives in teach- ing this so-called lesson. A foot rested on Harry’s buttocks and a moment later Harry was pushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back. Derrick laughed. “This is fun,” he said. All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing to the Headmaster’s office. That would be the end of this Defence Professor and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts and…Professor McGonagall would be angry about that, but… (An image of Professor McGonagall’s face flashed before his eyes, she didn’t look angry, just sad—) “Now tell him that he’s better than you, Potter,” said Professor Quir- rell’s voice. “You’re, better, than, me.” Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his chest and shoved him back down to the mat. The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action and their consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity. The fool wouldn’t be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in the groin would stun him long enough for— “Try again,” said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp motion Harry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where stood his real enemy, the Defence Professor— Professor Quirrell said, “You have no patience.” Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a picture of a wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth after Harry had ripped his tongue out— A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then sat down on him, sending Harry’s breath whooshing out. “Stop!” Harry screamed. “Please stop!” “Better,” said Professor Quirrell. “That even sounded sincere.” It had been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening thing, it had been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly, fear and cold anger both flushing through him— “Lose,” said Professor Quirrell. “I, lose,” Harry forced out. “I like it,” Derrick said from on top of him. “Lose some more.” 305 CH APTER 19 306 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 307 CH APTER 19 308 DELAYE D GRATIFICATION 309 311 CH APTER 2 0 312 BAYES’S THEOREM 313 CH APTER 2 0 314 BAYES’S THEOREM 315 CH APTER 2 0 316 BAYES’S THEOREM 317 CH APTER 2 0 318 BAYES’S THEOREM 319 CH APTER 2 0 32 0 BAYES’S THEOREM 321 CH APTER 2 0 32 2 BAYES’S THEOREM 323 CH APTER 2 0 324 BAYES’S THEOREM 325 CH APTER 2 0 326 BAYES’S THEOREM 327 CH APTER 2 0 328 329 CH APTER 2 1 330 RATIONALIZATION 331 CH APTER 2 1 A silent figure quietly slipped through the chilled halls of the Hog- warts dungeons. He was to be present in a certain room at 6:00 p.m. to meet a certain someone, and if at all possible it was best to be early, to show respect. But when his hand turned the doorknob and opened the door into that dark, silent, unused classroom, there was a silhouette already standing there amid the rows of dusty old desks. A silhouette which held a small green glowing rod, casting a pale light which hardly illuminated even he who held it, let alone the surrounding room. The light of the hallway died as the door closed and shut behind him, and Draco’s eyes began the process of adjusting to the dim glow. The silhouette slowly turned to behold him, revealing a shadowed face only partially lit by the eerie green light. Draco liked this meeting already. Keep the chill green light, make them both taller, give them hoods and masks, move them from a class- room to a graveyard, and it would be just like the start of half the stories his father’s friends told about the Death Eaters. “I want you to know, Draco Malfoy,” said the silhouette in tones of deadly calm, “that I do not blame you for my recent defeat.” Draco opened his mouth in unthinking protest, there was no possible reason why he should be blamed— “It was due, more than anything else, to my own stupidity,” continued that shadowy figure. “There were many other things I could have done, at any step along the way. You did not ask me to do exactly what I did. You only asked for help. I was the one who unwisely chose that particular method. But the fact remains that I lost the contest by half a book. The actions of your pet idiot, and the favour you asked for, and, yes, my own foolishness in going about it, caused me to lose time. More time than you know. Time which, in the end, proved critical. The fact remains, Draco Malfoy, that if you had not asked that favour, I would have won. And not… instead…lost.” Draco had already heard about Harry’s loss, and the forfeit Granger had claimed from him. The news had spread faster than owls could have carried it. “I understand,” Draco said. “I’m sorry.” There was nothing else he could say if he wanted Harry Potter to be friends with him. “I am not asking for understanding or sorrow,” said the dark silhou- ette, still with that deadly calm. “But I have just spent two full hours in the presence of Hermione Granger, dressed in such clothing as was provided me, visiting such fascinating places in Hogwarts as a tiny burbling water- fall of what looked to me like snot, accompanied by a number of other girls who insisted on such helpful activities as strewing our path with Transfig- ured rose petals. I have been on a date, scion of Malfoy. My first date. And when I call that favour due, you will pay it.” Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving he had taken the wise precau- tion of learning every available detail of Harry’s date, so that he could get all of his hysterical laughing done before their appointed meeting time, and would not commit a faux pas by giggling continuously until he lost consciousness. “Do you think,” Draco said, “that something sad ought to happen to the Granger girl—” “Spread the word in Slytherin that the Granger girl is mine and anyone who meddles in my affairs will have their remains scattered over an area wide enough to include twelve different spoken languages. And since I am not in Gryffindor and I use cunning rather than immediate frontal attacks, they should not panic if I am seen smiling at her.” “Or if you’re seen on a second date?” Draco said, allowing just a tiny note of skepticism into his voice. “There will be no second date,” said the green-lit silhouette in a voice so fearsome that it sounded, not only like a Death Eater, but like Amycus Carrow that one time just before Father told him to stop it, he wasn’t the Dark Lord. Of course it was still a young boy’s high unbroken voice and when you combined that with the actual words, well, it just didn’t work. If Harry Pot- ter did become the next Dark Lord some day, Draco would use a Pensieve to store a copy of this memory somewhere safe, and Harry Potter would never dare betray him. “But let us talk of happier matters,” said the green-shadowed figure. “Let us talk of knowledge and of power. Draco Malfoy, let us talk of Sci- ence.” “Yes,” said Draco. “Let us speak.” Draco wondered how much of his own face could be seen, and how much was in shadow, in that eerie green light. And though Draco kept his face serious, there was a smile in his heart. He was finally having a real grown-up conversation. “I offer you power,” said the shadowy figure, “and I will tell you of that power and its price. The power comes from knowing the shape of reality and so gaining control over it. What you understand, you can command, and that is power enough to walk upon the Moon. The price of that power is that you must learn to ask questions of Nature, and far more difficult, accept Nature’s answers. You will do experiments, perform tests and see what happens. And you must accept the meaning of those results when they tell you that you are mistaken. You will have to learn how to lose, not to me, but to Nature. When you find yourself arguing with reality, you will have to let reality win. You will find this painful, Draco Malfoy, and I do not know if you are strong in that way. Knowing the price, is it still your wish to learn the human power?” Draco took a deep breath. He’d thought about this. And it was hard to see how he could answer any other way. He’d been instructed to take ev- ery avenue of friendship with Harry Potter. It was just learning, he wasn’t promising to do anything. He could always stop the lessons at any time… There were certainly any number of things about the situation which made it look like a trap, but in all honesty, Draco didn’t see how this could go wrong. Plus Draco did kind of want to rule the world. “Yes,” said Draco. “Excellent,” said the shadowy figure. “I have had something of a crowded week, and it will take time to plan your curriculum—” “I’ve got a lot of things I need to do myself to consolidate my power in Slytherin,” said Draco, “not to mention homework. Maybe we should just start in October?” “Sounds sensible,” said the shadowy figure, “but what I meant to say is that to plan your curriculum, I need to know what I will be teaching you. Three thoughts come to me. The first is that I teach you of the hu- man mind and brain. The second option is that I teach you of the physical universe, those arts which lie on the pathway to visiting the Moon. This involves a great deal of numbers, but to a certain kind of mind those num- bers are more beautiful than anything else Science has to teach. Do you like numbers, Draco?” Draco shook his head. “Then so much for that. You will learn your mathematics eventually, but not right away, I think. The third option is that I teach you of genetics and evolution and inheritance, what you would call blood—” “That one,” said Draco. The figure nodded. “I thought you might say as much. But I think it will be the most painful path for you, Draco. What if your family and friends, the blood purists, say one thing, and you find that the experimen- tal test says another?” “Then I’ll figure out how to make the experimental test say the right answer!” There was a pause, as the shadowy figure stood there with its mouth open for a short while. “Um,” said the shadowy figure. “It doesn’t really work like that. That’s what I was trying to warn you about here, Draco. You can’t make the an- swer come out to be anything you like.” “You can always make the answer come out your way,” said Draco. That had been practically the first thing his tutors had taught him. “It’s just a matter of finding the right arguments.” “No,” said the shadowy figure, voice rising in frustration, “no, no, no! Then you get the wrong answer and you can’t go to the Moon that way! Na- ture isn’t a person, you can’t trick them into believing something else, if you try to tell the Moon it’s made of cheese you can argue for days and it won’t change the Moon! What you’re talking about is rationalization, like starting with a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line, using ink to write ‘and therefore, the Moon is made of cheese’, and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever arguments above. But either the Moon is made of cheese or it isn’t. The moment you wrote the bottom line, it was already true or already false. Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with the right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant you write down the bottom line. If you’re trying to pick be- tween two expensive trunks, and you like the shiny one, it doesn’t matter what clever arguments you come up with for buying it, the real rule you used to choose which trunk to argue for was ‘pick the shiny one’, and however effective that rule is at picking good trunks, that’s the kind of trunk you’ll get. Rationality can’t be used to argue for a fixed side, its only possible use is deciding which side to argue. Science isn’t for convincing anyone that the blood purists are right. That’s politics! The power of science comes from finding out the way Nature really is that can’t be changed by arguing! What sci- ence can do is tell us how blood really works, how wizards really inherit their powers from their parents, and whether Muggle-borns are really weaker or stronger—” “Stronger!” said Draco. He had been trying to follow this, a puzzled frown on his face, he could see how it sort of made sense but it certainly wasn’t like anything he’d ever heard before. And then Harry Potter had said something Draco couldn’t possibly let pass. “You think mudbloods are stronger?” “I think nothing,” said the shadowy figure. “I know nothing. I believe nothing. My bottom line is not yet written. I will figure out how to test the magical strength of Muggle-borns, and the magical strength of pure- bloods. If my tests tell me that Muggle-borns are weaker, I will believe they are weaker. If my tests tell me that Muggle-borns are stronger, I will believe they are stronger. Knowing this and other truths, I will gain some measure of power—” “And you expect me to believe whatever you say?” Draco demanded hotly. “I expect you to perform the tests personally,” said the shadowy figure quietly. “Are you afraid of what you will find?” Draco stared at the shadowy figure for a while, his eyes narrowed. “Nice trap, Harry,” he said. “I’ll have to remember that one, it’s new.” The shadowy figure shook his head. “It’s not a trap, Draco. Remember, I don’t know what we’ll find. But you do not understand the universe by ar- guing with it or telling it to come back with a different answer next time. When you put on the robes of a scientist you must forget all your politics and arguments and factions and sides, silence the desperate clingings of your mind, and wish only to hear the answer of Nature.” The shadowy fig- ure paused. “Most people can’t do it. That’s why this is difficult. Are you sure you wouldn’t rather just learn about the brain?” “And if I tell you I’d rather learn about the brain,” Draco said, his voice now hard, “you’ll go around telling people that I was afraid of what I’d find.” “No,” said the shadowy figure. “I will do no such thing.” “But you might do the same sort of tests yourself, and if you got the wrong answer, I wouldn’t be there to say anything before you showed it to someone else.” Draco’s voice was still hard. “I would still ask you first, Draco,” the shadowy figure said quietly. Draco paused. He hadn’t been expecting that, he’d thought he saw the trap but…“You would?” “Of course. How would I know who to blackmail or what we could ask from them? Draco, I say again that this is not a trap I set for you. At least not for you personally. If your politics were different, I would be saying, what if the test shows that purebloods are stronger.” “Really.” “Yes! That’s the price anyone has to pay to become a scientist!” Draco held up a hand. He had to think. The shadowy, green-lit figure waited. It didn’t take long to think about, though. If you discarded all the con- fusing parts…then Harry Potter was planning to mess around with some- thing that could cause a gigantic political explosion, and it would be in- sane to just walk away and let him do it on his own. “We’ll study blood,” said Draco. “Excellent,” said the figure, and smiled. “Congratulations on being will- ing to ask the question.” “Thanks,” Draco said, not quite managing to keep the irony out of his voice. “Hey, did you think going to the Moon was easy? Be glad this just in- volves changing your mind sometimes, and not a human sacrifice!” “Human sacrifice would be way easier!” There was a slight pause, and then the figure nodded. “Fair point.” “Look, Harry,” said Draco without much hope, “I thought the idea was to take all the things that Muggles know, combine them with things that wizards know, and become masters of both worlds. Wouldn’t it be a lot easier to just study all the things that Muggles already found out, like the Moon stuff, and use that power—” “No,” said the figure with a sharp shake of his head, sending green shadows moving around his nose and eyes. His voice had turned very grim. “If you cannot learn the scientist’s art of accepting reality, then I must not tell you what that acceptance has discovered. It would be like a powerful wizard telling you of those gates which must not be opened, and those seals which must not be broken, before you had proven your intelligence and discipline by surviving the lesser perils.” A chill went down Draco’s spine and he shuddered involuntarily. He knew it had been visible even in the dim light. “All right,” said Draco. “I un- derstand.” Father had told him that many times. When a more powerful wizard told you that you weren’t ready to know, you didn’t pry any further if you wanted to live. The figure inclined his head. “Indeed. But there is something else you should understand. The first scientists, being Muggles, lacked your tra- ditions. In the beginning they simply did not comprehend the notion of dangerous knowledge, and thought that all things known should be spo- ken freely. When their searches turned dangerous, they told their politi- cians of things that should have stayed secret—don’t look like that, Draco, it wasn’t simple stupidity. They did have to be smart enough to uncover the secret in the first place. But they were Muggles, it was the first time they’d found anything really dangerous, and they didn’t start out with a tra- dition of secrecy. There was a war going on, and the scientists on one side worried that if they didn’t talk, the scientists of the enemy country would tell their politicians first…” The voice trailed off significantly. “They didn’t destroy the world. But it was close. And we are not going to repeat that mistake.” “Right,” Draco said, his voice now very firm. “We won’t. We’re wizards, and studying science doesn’t make us Muggles.” “As you say,” said the green-lit silhouette. “We will establish our own Science, a magical Science, and that Science will have smarter traditions from the very start.” The voice grew hard. “The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the disciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be keyed to your progress in those disciplines, and you will share that knowledge with no-one else who has not learned those disciplines. Do you accept this?” “Yes,” said Draco. What was he supposed to do, say no? “Good. And what you discover for yourself, you will keep to yourself unless you think that other scientists are ready to know it. What we do share among ourselves, we will not tell the world unless we agree it is safe for the world to know. And whatever our own politics and allegiances, we will all punish any of our number who reveal dangerous magics or give away dangerous weapons, no matter what sort of war is going on. From this day onward, that will be the tradition and the law of science among wizards. Are we agreed on that?” “Yes,” said Draco. Actually this was starting to sound pretty attractive. The Death Eaters had tried to take power by being scarier than everyone else, and they hadn’t actually won yet. Maybe it was time to try ruling us- ing secrets instead. “And our group stays hidden for as long as possible, and everyone in it has to agree to our rules.” “Of course. Definitely.” There was a very short pause. “We’re going to need better robes,” said the shadowy figure, “with hoods and so on—” “I was just thinking that,” said Draco. “We don’t need whole new robes, though, just cowled cloaks to put on. I have a friend in Slytherin, she’ll take your measurements—” “Don’t tell her what it’s for, though—” “I’m not stupid!” “And no masks for now, not when it’s just you and me—” said the shad- owy figure. “Right! But later on we should have some sort of special mark that all our servants have, the Mark of Science, like a snake eating the Moon on their right arms—” “It’s called a PhD and wouldn’t that make it too easy to identify our people?” “Huh?” “I mean, what if someone is like ‘okay, now everyone pull up their robes over their right arms’ and our guy is like ‘whoops, sorry, looks like I’m a spy’—” ‘“Forget I said anything,” said Draco, sweat suddenly springing out all over his body. He needed a distraction, fast—“And what do we call our- selves? The Science Eaters?” “No,” said the shadowy figure slowly. “That doesn’t sound right…” Draco wiped his robed arm across his forehead, wiping away beads of moisture. What had the Dark Lord been thinking? Father had said the Dark Lord was smart! “I’ve got it!” said the shadowy figure suddenly. “You won’t understand yet, but trust me, it fits.” Right now Draco would have accepted ‘Malfoy Munchers’ as long as it changed the subject. “What is it?” And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in the dungeons of Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter spread his arms dramatically and said, “This day shall mark the dawn of…the Bayesian Conspiracy.” 341 CH APTER 2 1 342 RATIONALIZATION 343 CH APTER 2 1 It was Sunday morning and Harry was eating pancakes in the Great Hall, sharp quick bites, glancing nervously at his watch every few sec- onds. It was 8:02 a.m., and in precisely two hours and one minute, it would be exactly one week since he’d seen the Weasleys and crossed over onto Plat- form Nine-and-Three-Quarters. And the thought had occurred to him…Harry didn’t know if this was a valid way to think about the universe, he didn’t know anything any more, but it seemed possible… That… Not enough interesting things had happened to him over the last week. When he was done eating breakfast, Harry planned to go straight up to his room and hide in the bottom level of his trunk and not talk to anyone until 10:03 a.m. And that was when Harry saw the Weasley twins walking toward him. One of them was carrying something concealed behind his back. He should scream and run away. He should scream and run away. Whatever this was…it could very well be… …the grand finale… He really should just scream and run away. With a resigned feeling that the universe would come and get him any- way, Harry continued slicing at the pancake with his fork and knife. He couldn’t muster the energy. That was the sad truth. Harry knew now how people felt when they were tired of running, tired of trying to escape fate, and they just fell to the ground and let the horrifically be-fanged and ten- tacled demons of the darkest abyss drag them off to their unspeakable destiny. The Weasley twins drew closer. And yet closer. Harry ate another bite of pancake. The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly. “Hello, Fred,” Harry said dully. One of the twins nodded. “Hello, George.” The other twin nodded. “You sound tired,” said George. “You should cheer up,” said Fred. “Look what we got you!” And George took, from behind Fred’s back— A cake with twelve flaming candles. There was a pause, as the Ravenclaw table stared at them. “That’s not right,” said someone. “Harry Potter was born on the thirty- first of Jul—” “He is coming,” said a huge hollow voice that cut through all conver- sation like a sword of ice. “The one who will tear apart the very—” Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over the Head Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words, Fawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a crack of fire. There was a shocked pause… …followed by heads turning in the direction of Harry Potter. “I didn’t do it,” Harry said in a tired voice. “That was a prophecy!” someone at the table hissed. “And I bet it’s about you!” Harry sighed. He stood up from his seat, raised his voice, and said very loudly over the conversations that were starting up, “It’s not about me! Obviously! I’m not coming here, I’m already here!” Harry sat back down again. The people who had been looking at him turned away again. Someone else at the table said, “Then who is it about?” And with a dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized who wasn’t already at Hogwarts. Call it a wild guess, but Harry had a feeling the undead Dark Lord would be showing up one of these days. The conversation continued on around him. “Not to mention, tear apart the very what?” “I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an ‘S’ just before the Headmaster grabbed her.” “Like…soul? Sun?” “If someone’s going to tear apart the Sun we’re really in trouble!” That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world contained scary things which had heard of David Criswell’s ideas about star lifting. “So,” Harry said in tired tones, “this happens every Sunday breakfast, does it?” “No,” said a student who might have been in his seventh year, frowning grimly. “It doesn’t.” Harry shrugged. “Whatever. Anyone want some birthday cake?” “But it’s not your birthday!” said the same student who’d objected last time. That was the cue for Fred and George to start laughing, of course. Even Harry managed a weary smile. As the first slice was served to him, Harry said, “I’ve had a really long week.” 346 RATIONALIZATION 347 CH APTER 2 1 348 349 351 CH APTER 2 2 352 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 353 CH APTER 2 2 354 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 355 CH APTER 2 2 356 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 357 CH APTER 2 2 358 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD In the dungeons of Slytherin. An unused classroom lit with eerie green light, much brighter this time and coming from a small crystal globe with a temporary enchant- ment, but eerie green light nonetheless, casting strange shadows from the dusty desks. Two boy-sized figures in cowled grey cloaks (no masks) had entered in silence, and sat down in two chairs opposite the same desk. It was the second meeting of the Bayesian Conspiracy. Draco Malfoy hadn’t been sure if he should look forward to it or not. Harry Potter, judging by the expression on his face, didn’t seem to have any doubts on the appropriate mood. Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone. “Hermione Granger,” said Harry Potter, just as Draco was opening his mouth. “Don’t ask.” He couldn’t have gone on another date, could he? thought Draco, but that didn’t make any sense. “Harry,” said Draco, “I’m sorry but I have to ask this anyway, did you really order the mudblood girl an expensive mokeskin pouch for her birth- day?” “Yes, I did. You’ve already worked out why, of course.” Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in frustration, his cowl brushing the back of his hand. He hadn’t been quite sure why, but now he couldn’t say so. And Slytherin knew he was courting Harry Pot- ter, he’d made it obvious enough in Defence class. “Harry,” said Draco, “people know I’m friends with you, they don’t know about the Conspiracy of course, but they know we’re friends, and it makes me look bad when you do that sort of thing.” Harry Potter’s face tightened. “Anyone in Slytherin who can’t under- stand the concept of acting nice toward people you don’t actually like should be ground up and fed to pet snakes.” “There are a lot of people in Slytherin who don’t,” Draco said, his voice serious. “Most people are stupid, and you have to look good in front of them anyway.” Harry Potter had to understand that if he ever wanted to get anywhere in life. “What do you care what other people think? Are you really going to live your life needing to explain everything you do to the dumbest idiots in Sly- therin, letting them judge you? I’m sorry, Draco, but I’m not lowering my cunning plots to the level of what the dumbest Slytherins can understand, just because it might make you look bad otherwise. Not even your friend- ship is worth that. It would take all the fun out of life. Tell me you haven’t ever thought the same thing when someone in Slytherin is being too stupid to breathe, that it’s beneath the dignity of a Malfoy to have to pander to them.” Draco genuinely hadn’t. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like breathing, you did it without thinking about it. “Harry,” Draco said at last. “Just doing whatever you want, without worrying about how it looks, isn’t smart. The Dark Lord worried about how he looked! He was feared and hated, and he knew exactly what sort of fear and hate he wanted to create. Everyone has to worry about what other people think.” The cowled figure shrugged. “Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tell you about something called Asch’s Conformity Experiment, you might find it quite amusing. For now I’ll just note that it’s dangerous to worry about what other people think on instinct, because you actually care, not as a matter of cold-blooded calculation. Remember, I was beaten and bul- lied by older Slytherins for fifteen minutes, and afterwards I stood up and graciously forgave them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought to do. But my cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I have no use for the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since I don’t own a pet snake. So I have no reason to care what they think about how I conduct my duel with Hermione Granger.” Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. “She’s just some mud- blood,” Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than shouting. “If you don’t like her, push her down the stairs.” “Ravenclaw would know—” “Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn’t even have to manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she’d do it!” “I would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading contest, she’s get- ting better grades than me, I have to defeat her with my brain or it doesn’t count!” “She’s just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that much?” “She’s a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some powerless idiot in Slytherin thinks?” “It’s called politics! And if you can’t play it you can’t have power!” “Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is power! There are kinds of power that don’t require me to spend the rest of my life pandering to morons!” Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began taking deep breaths to calm themselves. “Sorry,” Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat from his forehead. “Sorry, Draco. You’ve got a lot of political power and it makes sense for you to keep it. You should be calculating what Slytherin thinks. It’s an important game and I shouldn’t have insulted it. But you can’t ask me to lower the level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don’t look bad by associating with me. Tell Slytherin you’re gritting your teeth while you pretend to be my friend.” That was exactly what Draco had told Slytherin, and he still wasn’t sure whether it was true. “Anyway,” Draco said. “Speaking of your image. I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you and she’s been asking questions.” Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. “Who?” “She writes for the Daily Prophet,” Draco said. He tried to keep the worry out of his voice. The Daily Prophet was one of Father’s primary tools, he used it like a wizard’s wand. “That’s the newspaper people actually pay attention to. Rita Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it, uses her quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can’t find any rumours about you, she’ll just make up her own.” “I see,” said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked very thoughtful be- neath the cowl. Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now some- one had certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry Potter, and Father would also know that Draco hadn’t written home about it, and Father would understand that Draco didn’t think he could actually keep it a secret, which sent a clear message that Draco was practising his own game now but still on Father’s side, since if Draco had been tempted away, he would have been sending false reports. It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco was about to say next. Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving sensa- tion. Even if they were on the same side. It was, on the one hand, exhila- rating, but Draco also knew that in the end it would turn out that Father had played the game better. There was no other way it could possibly go. “Harry,” Draco finally said. “This isn’t a suggestion. This isn’t my advice. Just the way it is. My father could almost certainly quash that article. But it would cost you.” That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter exactly that was not something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter would work it out on his own, or not. But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the cowl. “I have no intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter.” Draco didn’t even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice. “You can’t tell me you don’t care what the newspaper says about you!” “I care less than you might think,” said Harry Potter. “But I have my own ways of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don’t need Lucius’s help.” A worried look came over Draco’s face before he could stop it. What- ever Harry Potter was about to do next, it would be something Father wasn’t expecting, and Draco was feeling very nervous about where that might lead. Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath the cowl. He’d never actually worn one of those before, and hadn’t realized that the Death Eaters’ cloaks probably had things like Cooling Charms. Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced, took out his wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said “Frigideiro!” Moments later Draco felt the cold draft. “Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!” Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bit shaky, and put it back into his robes. The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have done that too, but still, not bad. “So,” Draco said. “Science. You’re going to tell me about blood.” “We’re going to find out about blood,” Harry Potter said. “By doing ex- periments.” “All right,” Draco said. “What sort of experiments?” Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, “You tell me.” 363 CH APTER 2 2 364 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 365 CH APTER 2 2 366 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 367 CH APTER 2 2 368 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 369 CH APTER 2 2 370 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 371 CH APTER 2 2 372 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 373 CH APTER 2 2 374 THE SCIE NTIFIC METHOD 375 377 CH APTER 2 3 378 BELIEF IN BELIEF 379 CH APTER 2 3 380 BELIEF IN BELIEF 381 CH APTER 2 3 382 BELIEF IN BELIEF It didn’t take long after that. It was a wide portrait, but the three people in it were looking rather crowded. There was a middle-aged man from the twelfth century, dressed in black swathes of cloth; who spoke to a sad-looking young woman from the fourteenth century, with hair that seemed to constantly frizz about her head as if she’d been charged up by a static spell; and she spoke to a dignified, wizened old man from the seventeenth century with a solid gold bow tie; and him they could understand. They had asked about Dementors. They had asked about phœnixes. They had asked about dragons and trolls and house elves. Harry had frowned, pointed out that creatures which needed the most magic could just be dying out entirely, and had asked for the most power- ful magical creatures known. There wasn’t anything unfamiliar on the list, except for a species of Dark creature called mind flayers which the translator noted had finally been exterminated by Harold Shea, and those didn’t sound half as scary as Dementors. Magical creatures were as powerful now as they’d ever been, appar- ently. The sickness in Draco’s stomach was easing, and now he just felt con- fused. “Harry,” Draco said in the middle of the old man translating a list of all eleven powers of a beholder’s eyes, “what does this mean?” Harry held up a finger and the old man finished the list. Then Harry thanked all the portraits for helping—Draco, pretty much on automatic, did so as well and more graciously—and they headed back to the classroom. And Harry brought out the original parchment with the hypotheses, and began scribbling. Observation: Wizardry isn’t as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was founded. 1. Magic itself is fading. Hypotheses: 2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs. 3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost. 4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or some- thing else besides blood is making them grow up weaker. 5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?) 6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child? Check if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any children.) Tests: A. Are there spells we know but can’t cast (1 or 2) or are the lost spells no longer known (3)? Result: Inconclusive due to Inter- dict of Merlin. No known uncastable spell, but could simply have not been passed on. B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of spells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2, but blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.) Result: Same level of first-year spells then as now. C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using scientific knowledge of blood, will explain later. Result: There’s only one place in the recipe that makes you a wizard, and either you have two papers saying ‘magic’ or you don’t. D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes 1 from (2 or 3). Result: Magical creatures seem to be as strong as they ever were. “A failed,” said Harry Potter. “B is weak evidence for 1 over 2. C falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4 as well. 5 was unlikely and D argues against it. 6 is falsified along with 2. That leaves 3. Interdict of Merlin or not, I didn’t actually find any known spell that couldn’t be cast. So when you add it all up, it looks like knowledge is being lost.” And the trap snapped shut. As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood that magic wasn’t fading out, it took all of five seconds to realize. Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard that his chair skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and fell over. “So it was all just a stupid trick, then.” Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he spoke, his voice was quiet. “It was a fair test, Draco. If it had come out a different way, I would have accepted it. That’s not something I would ever cheat on. Ever. I didn’t look at your data before I made my predictions. I told you up front when the Interdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment—” “Oh,” Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice, “you didn’t know how the whole thing was going to come out?” “I didn’t know anything you didn’t know,” Harry said, still quietly. “I admit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too powerful, she should have been barely magical and she wasn’t, how can a Muggle-born be the best spell-caster in Hogwarts? And she’s getting the best grades on her essays too, it’s too much coincidence for one girl to be the strongest mag- ically and academically unless there’s a single cause. Hermione Granger’s existence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a wizard, something you either have or you don’t, and the power differences coming from how much we know and how much we practise. And there weren’t different classes for purebloods and Muggle-borns, and so on. There were too many ways the world didn’t look the way it would look if you were right. But Draco, I didn’t see anything you couldn’t see too. I didn’t perform any tests I didn’t tell you about. I didn’t cheat, Draco. I wanted us to work out the answer together. And I never thought that magic might be fading out of the world until you said it. It was a scary idea for me, too.” “Whatever,” Draco said. He was working very hard to control his voice and not just start screaming at Harry. “You claim you’re not going to run off and tell anyone else about this.” “Not without consulting you first,” Harry said. He opened his hands in a pleading gesture. “Draco, I’m being as nice as I can but the world turned out to just not be that way.” “Fine. Then you and I are through. I’m going to just walk away and forget any of this ever happened.” Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat, the sense of betrayal, and that was when he realized he really had liked Harry Potter, and that thought didn’t slow him down for a moment as he strode toward the classroom door. And Harry Potter’s voice came, now louder, and worried: “Draco…you can’t forget. Don’t you understand? That was your sacri- fice.” Draco stopped in mid-stride and turned around. “What are you talk- ing about?” But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco’s spine. He knew even before Harry Potter said it. “To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not just a small belief but something that had great significance to you. You did ex- periments, gathered data, and the outcome proved the belief was wrong. You saw the results and understood what they meant.” Harry Potter’s voice was faltering. “Remember, Draco, you can’t sacrifice a true belief that way, because the experiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it. Your sacrifice to become a scientist was your false belief that wizard blood was mixing and getting weaker.” “That’s not true!” said Draco. “I didn’t sacrifice the belief. I still believe that!” His voice was getting louder, and the chill was getting worse. Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper. “Draco… I’m sorry, Draco, you don’t believe it, not any more.” Harry’s voice rose again. “I’ll prove it to you. Imagine that someone tells you they’re keeping a dragon in their house. You tell them you want to see it. They say it’s an in- visible dragon. You say fine, you’ll listen to it move. They say it’s an inaudi- ble dragon. You say you’ll throw some cooking flour into the air and see the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to flour. And the telling thing is that they know, in advance, exactly which experimen- tal results they’ll have to explain away. They know everything will come out the way it does if there’s no dragon, they know in advance just which ex- cuses they’ll have to make. So maybe they say there’s a dragon. Maybe they believe they believe there’s a dragon, it’s called “belief in belief”. But they don’t actually believe it. You can be mistaken about what you believe, most people never realize there’s a difference between believing something and thinking it’s good to believe it.” Harry Potter had risen from the desk now, and taken a few steps toward Draco. “And Draco, you don’t believe any more in blood purism, I’ll show you that you don’t. If blood purism is true, then Hermione Granger doesn’t make sense, so what could explain her? Maybe she’s a wizarding orphan raised by Muggles, just like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see pictures of her parents, to see if she looks like them. Would you expect her to look different? Should we go perform that test?” “They would have put her with relatives,” Draco said, his voice trem- bling. “They’ll still look the same.” “You see. You already know what experimental result you’ll have to ex- cuse. If you still believed in blood purism you would say, sure, let’s go take a look, I bet she won’t look like her parents, she’s too powerful to be a real Muggle-born—” “They would have put her with relatives!” “Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the true child of a father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her family enough. She wouldn’t be afraid of the results. So what do you expect that test to show? Tell me to run it and we will. But you already know what the test will say. You’ll always know. You won’t ever be able to forget. You might wish you believed in blood purism, but you’ll always expect to see happen just exactly what would happen if there was only one thing that made you a wizard. That was your sacrifice to become a scientist.” Draco’s breathing was ragged. “Do you realize what you’ve done?” Draco surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar of his robes. His voice rose to a scream, it sounded unbearably loud in the closed classroom and the silence. “Do you realize what you’ve done?” Harry’s voice was shaky. “You had a belief. The belief was false. I helped you see that. What’s true is already so, owning up to it doesn’t make it worse—” The fingers on Draco’s right hand clenched into a fist and that hand dropped down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry Potter in the jaw so hard that his body went crashing back into a desk and then to the floor. “Idiot!” screamed Draco. “Idiot! Idiot!” “Draco,” whispered Harry from the floor, “Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’t think this would happen for months, I didn’t expect you to awaken as a scientist this quickly, I thought I would have longer to prepare you, teach you the techniques that make it hurt less to admit you’re wrong—” “What about Father?” Draco said. His voice trembled with rage. “Were you going to prepare him or did you just not care what happened after this?” “You can’t tell him!” Harry said, his voice rising in alarm. “He’s not a scientist! You promised, Draco!” For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a relief. And then the real anger started to rise. “So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still believe,” Draco said, voice shaking. “I’ll always have to lie to him, and now when I grow up I can’t be a Death Eater, and I won’t even be able to tell him why not.” “If your father really loves you,” whispered Harry from the floor, “he’ll still love you even if you don’t become a Death Eater, and it sounds like your father does really love you, Draco—” “Your stepfather is a scientist,” Draco said. The words coming out like biting knives. “If you weren’t going to be a scientist, he would still love you. But you’d be a little less special to him.” Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say ‘I’m sorry’, and then closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it, which was either very smart of him or very lucky, because Draco might have tried to kill him. “You should have warned me,” Draco said. His voice rose. “You should have warned me!” “I…I did…every time I told you about the power, I told you about the price. I said, you have to admit you’re wrong. I said this would be the hard- est path for you. That this was the sacrifice anyone had to make to become a scientist. I said, what if the experiment says one thing and your family and friends say another—” “You call that a warning?” Draco was screaming now. “You call that a warn- ing? When we’re doing a ritual that calls for a permanent sacrifice?” “I…I…” The boy on the floor swallowed. “I guess maybe it wasn’t clear. I’m sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the truth should be.” Hitting him wasn’t enough. “You’re wrong about one thing,” Draco said, his voice deadly. “Granger isn’t the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the best grades in class. You’re about to find out the difference.” Sudden shock showed in Harry’s face, and he tried to roll quickly to his feet— It was already too late for him. “Expelliarmus!” Harry’s wand flew across the room. “Gom jabbar!” A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry’s left hand. “That’s a torture spell,” said Draco. “It’s for getting information out of people. I’m just going to leave it on you and lock the door behind me when I go. Maybe I’ll set the locking spell to wear off after a few hours. Maybe it won’t wear off until you die in here. Have fun.” Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco’s hand dipped down, picked up his book bag, without his aim wavering. The pain was already showing in Harry Potter’s face as he spoke. “Mal- foys are above the underage magic laws, I take it? It’s not because your blood is stronger. It’s because you already practised. In the beginning you were as weak as any of us. Is my prediction wrong?” Draco’s hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed steady. “Just so you know,” Harry said through gritted teeth, “if you’d told me I was wrong I would have listened. I won’t ever torture you when you show me that I’m wrong. And you will. Someday. You’re awakened as a scientist now, and even if you never learn to use your power, you’ll always,” Harry gasped, “be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs—” Draco’s backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and he had to work to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open the door and stepped back out of the classroom. Then Draco shut the door again. He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew. Draco waited until he heard Harry’s first scream before casting the Quietus. And then he walked away. 391 CH APTER 2 3 39 2 BELIEF IN BELIEF 393 CH APTER 2 3 394 BELIEF IN BELIEF The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For some reason Draco himself wasn’t feeling very hungry. Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it shut, Quieted it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair. It was the first time Draco had ever really lost, Father had warned him that losing for real would hurt the first time it happened, but he’d lost so much, it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fair for him to lose everything the very first time he lost. Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked was screaming in pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he’d liked before. Pun- ishing people who deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this just felt sick inside. Father hadn’t warned him about that, and Draco wondered if it was a hard lesson everyone had to learn when they grew up, or if Draco was just weak. Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt better. And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake to hurt Harry Potter. Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he’d done? Draco would sooner have been burned alive. Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there was nowhere else for him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn’t want him, then Draco would be nothing, just a pathetic little boy who could never be a Death Eater, never join Dumbledore’s faction, never learn science. The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father had warned Draco over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark rituals couldn’t be re- gained. But Father hadn’t known that the accursed Muggles had invented rituals that didn’t need wands, rituals you could be tricked into doing without knowing it, and that was only one of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which Harry Potter had brought with him. Draco started crying harder, then. He didn’t want this, he didn’t want this but there was no turning back. It was too late. He was already a scientist. Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and apologize. It would have been the smart thing to do. Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed. He’d already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco ever got to hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory for the rest of his life. Let him keep screaming. 396 BELIEF IN BELIEF 397 399 CH APTER 2 4 400 MACHIAV ELLIAN INTELLIG E NCE H YPOTHESIS 401 CH APTER 2 4 402 MACHIAV ELLIAN INTELLIG E NCE H YPOTHESIS 403 CH APTER 2 4 404 MACHIAV ELLIAN INTELLIG E NCE H YPOTHESIS 405 CH APTER 2 4 406 MACHIAV ELLIAN INTELLIG E NCE H YPOTHESIS 407 CH APTER 2 4 By the time they’d reached the dungeons, Draco had started pulling together his thoughts again. He was having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry had been trying to be friendly, he was just insane. And that wasn’t going to stop Draco’s revenge or even slow it down. “So,” Draco said, after looking around to make certain no-one was nearby. Their voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it never hurt to be extra sure. “I’ve been thinking. When we bring new recruits into the Conspiracy, they’re going to have to think we’re equals. Otherwise it would only take one of them to blow the plot to Father. You already worked that out, right?” “Naturally,” said Harry. “Will we be equals?” said Draco. “I’m afraid not,” Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to sound gentle, and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good deal of con- descension and not quite succeeding. “I’m sorry, Draco, but you don’t even know what the word Bayesian in Bayesian Conspiracy means right now. You’re going to have to study for months before we take anyone else in, just so you can put up a good front.” “Because I don’t know enough science,” Draco said, carefully keeping his voice neutral. Harry shook his head at that. “The problem isn’t that you’re ignorant of specific science things like deoxyribonucleic acid. That wouldn’t stop you from being my equal. The problem is that you aren’t trained in the meth- ods of rationality, the deeper secret knowledge behind how all those dis- coveries got made in the first place. I’ll try to teach you those, but they’re a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday, Draco. Yes, you did some of the work. But I was the only one in control. You answered some of the questions. I asked all of them. You helped push. I did the steering by myself. And without the methods of rationality, Draco, you can’t possibly steer the Conspiracy where it needs to go.” “I see,” said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed. Harry’s voice tried to gentle itself even more. “I’ll try to respect your expertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But you need to respect my expertise too, and there’s just no way you could be my equal when it comes to steering the Conspiracy. You’ve only been a scientist for one day, you know one secret about deoxyribonucleic acid, and you aren’t trained in any of the methods of rationality.” “I understand,” said Draco. And he did. People stuff, Harry had said. Seizing control of the Conspiracy probably wouldn’t even be difficult. And afterwards, he would kill Harry Potter just to be sure— The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last night, knowing Harry was screaming. Draco thought some more bad words. Fine. He wouldn’t kill Harry. Harry had been raised by Muggles, it wasn’t his fault he was insane. Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him that it had all been for Harry’s own good, really, he ought to be grateful— And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized that it actually was for Harry’s own good. If Harry tried to carry out his plan of playing Dumbledore and Father for fools, he would die. That made it perfect. Draco would take all of Harry’s dreams away from him, just as Harry had done to him. Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it would be absolutely true. Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to purify the wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as if he’d been a Death Eater. Harry Potter’s evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of right would prevail. The perfect revenge. Unless… Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist, Harry had told him. Draco didn’t have words to describe exactly what was wrong with Harry’s mind— (since Draco had never heard the term depth of recursion) —but he could guess what sort of plots it implied. …unless all that was exactly what Harry wanted Draco to do as part of some even larger plot which Draco would play right into by trying to foil this one, Harry might even know that his plan was unworkable, it might have no purpose except luring Draco to thwart it— No. That way lay madness. There had to be a limit. The Dark Lord him- self hadn’t been that twisty. That sort of thing didn’t happen in real life, only in Father’s silly bedtime stories about foolish gargoyles who always ended up furthering the hero’s plans every time they tried to stop him. 410 MACHIAV ELLIAN INTELLIG E NCE H YPOTHESIS 411 CH APTER 2 4 And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as he thought about his revenge. Someday, maybe in years but some day, Harry Potter would learn just what it meant to underestimate a Malfoy. Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had said that wasn’t supposed to happen for months. But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful sci- entist than anyone who wasn’t. So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter’s methods of rationality, and then when the time was ripe— CHAPTER TWENT Y-FI V E HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS Act 2 (The sun shone brilliantly into the Great Hall from the enchanted sky-ceiling above, illuminating the students as though they sat beneath the naked sky, gleaming from their plates and bowls, as, refreshed by a night’s sleep, they inhaled breakfast in preparation for whatever plans they’d made for their Sunday.) So. There was only one thing that made you a wizard. That wasn’t surprising, when you thought about it. What DNA mostly did was tell ribosomes how to chain amino acids together into proteins. Conventional physics seemed quite capable of describing amino acids, and no matter how many amino acids you chained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever get magic out of it. And yet magic seemed to be hereditary, following DNA. Then that probably wasn’t because the DNA was chaining together non- magical amino acids into magical proteins. Rather the key DNA sequence did not, of itself, give you your magic at all. Magic came from somewhere else. (At the Ravenclaw table there was one boy who was staring off into space, as his right hand automatically spooned some unimportant food into his mouth from whatever was in front of him. You probably could have substituted a pile of dirt and he wouldn’t have noticed.) And for some reason the Source of Magic was paying attention to a particular DNA marker among individuals who were ordinary ape- descended humans in every other way. (Actually there were quite a lot of boys and girls staring off into space. It was the Ravenclaw table, after all.) There were other lines of logic leading to the same conclusion. Complex machinery was always universal within a sexually reproducing species. If gene B relied on gene A, then A had to be useful on its own, and rise to near-universality in the gene pool on its own, before B would be useful of- ten enough to confer a fitness advantage. Then once B was universal you would get a variant A and B, then B 414 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 415 CH APTER 2 5 416 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS Act 1 “A reason?” said the old wizard. He restrained the fury from his face. The boy before him had been the victim, and certainly did not need to be frightened any further. “There is nothing that can excuse—” “What I did to him was worse.” The old wizard stiffened in sudden horror. “Harry, what have you done?” “I tricked Draco into believing that I’d tricked him into participating in a ritual that sacrificed his belief in blood purism. And that meant he couldn’t be a Death Eater when he grew up. He’d lost everything, Head- master.” There was a long quiet in the office, broken only by the tiny puffs and whistles of the fiddly things, which after enough time had come to seem like silence. “Dear me,” said the old wizard, “I do feel silly. And here I was expect- ing you might try to redeem the heir of Malfoy by, say, showing him true friendship and kindness.” “Ha! Yeah, like that would have worked.” The old wizard sighed. This was taking it too far. “Tell me, Harry. Did it even occur to you that there was something incongruous about setting out to redeem someone through lies and trickery?” “I did it without telling any direct lies, and since we’re talking about Draco Malfoy here, I think the word you’re looking for is congruous.” The boy looked rather smug. The old wizard shook his head in despair. “And this is the hero. We’re all doomed.” Act 5 418 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 419 CH APTER 2 5 Act 6 When Rita Skeeter was intent on a tasty prey, she didn’t tend to notice the scurrying ants who constituted the rest of the universe, which was how she almost bumped into the balding young man who’d stepped into her pathway. “Miss Skeeter,” said the man, sounding rather severe and cold for someone whose face looked that young. “Fancy running into you here.” “Out of my way, buster!” snapped Rita, and tried to step around him. The man in her pathway matched the movement so perfectly that it was like neither of them had moved at all, just stood still while the street shifted around them. Rita’s eyes narrowed. “Who do you think you are?” “How very foolish,” the man said dryly. “It would have been wise to memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry Potter to be the next Dark Lord. After all,” a thin smile, “that certainly sounds like someone you wouldn’t want to run into on the street, especially after do- ing a hatchet job on him in the newspaper.” Rita took a moment to place the reference. This was Quirinus Quirrell? He looked too young and too old at the same time; his face, if it relaxed from its severe and condescending pose, would belong to someone in his late thirties. And his hair was already falling out? Couldn’t he afford a healer? No, that wasn’t important, she had a time and a place and a beetle to be. She’d just received an anonymous tip about Madam Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be worth quite a bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was high on the hit list. The tipster had said that Bones and her young assistant were due to eat lunch in a special room at Mary’s Place, a very popular room for certain purposes; a room which, she’d found, was secure against all listening devices, but not proof against a beautiful blue beetle nestled up against one wall… “Out of my way!” Rita said, and tried to push Quirrell from her path. Quirrell’s arm brushed her own, deflecting, and Rita staggered as the thrust went into the thin air. Quirrell pulled up the sleeve of his left robe, showing his left arm. “Ob- serve,” said Quirrell, “no Dark Mark. I would like your paper to publish a retraction.” Rita let out an incredulous laugh. Of course the man wasn’t a real Death Eater. The paper wouldn’t have published it if he was. “Forget it, buster. Now take a hike.” Quirrell stared at her for a moment. Then he smiled. “Miss Skeeter,” said Quirrell, “I had hoped to find some lever that would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of simply crushing you.” “It’s been tried. Now get out of my way, buster, or I’ll find some Aurors and have you arrested for obstruction of journalism.” Quirrell swept her a small bow, and then walked past. “Goodbye, Rita Skeeter,” said his voice from behind her. As Rita bulled on ahead, she noted in the back of her mind that the man was whistling a tune as he walked away. Like that would scare her. 42 2 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 423 CH APTER 2 5 424 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 425 CH APTER 2 5 426 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 427 CH APTER 2 5 428 HOLD OFF ON PROPOSING SOLUTIONS 429 431 CH APTER 2 6 432 NOTICING CONFUSION 433 CH APTER 2 6 That Sunday there seemed to be a rather large number of people whis- pering in the hallways, at least when Harry Potter walked past them. And a lot of pointed fingers. And a great deal of female giggling. It had started at breakfast, when someone had asked Harry if he’d heard the news, and Harry had quickly interrupted and said that if the news was written by Rita Skeeter then he didn’t want to hear about it, he wanted to read it in the paper himself. It had then developed that not many students at Hogwarts got copies of the Daily Prophet, and that the copies which had not already been bought up from their owners were being passed around in some sort of complicated order and nobody really knew who had one at the moment… So Harry had used a Quieting Charm and gone on to eat his breakfast, trusting to his seat-mates to wave off the many, many questioners, and doing his best to ignore the incredulity, the laughter, the congratulatory smiles, the pitying looks, the fearful glances, and the dropped plates as new people came down for breakfast and heard. Harry was feeling rather curious, but it really wouldn’t have done to spoil the artistry by hearing it second hand. He’d done homework in the safety of his trunk for the next couple of hours, after telling his dorm-mates to come get him if anyone found him an original newspaper. Harry was still ignorant at 10 a.m., when he’d left Hogwarts in a car- riage with Professor Quirrell, who was in the front right, and currently slumped over in zombie-mode. Harry was sitting diagonally across, as far away as the carriage allowed, in the back left. Even so, Harry had a constant feeling of doom as the carriage rattled over a small path through a section of non-forbidden forest. It made it a bit hard to read, especially since the material was difficult, and Harry suddenly wished he was read- ing one of his childhood science-fiction books instead— “We’re outside the wards, Mr Potter,” said Professor Quirrell’s voice from the front. “Time to go.” Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked from the carriage, bracing himself as he stepped down. Harry, on his own side, jumped off. Harry was wondering exactly how they’d get there when Professor Quirrell said “Catch!” and threw a bronze Knut at him, and Harry caught it without thinking. A giant intangible hook caught at Harry’s abdomen and yanked him back, hard, only without any sense of acceleration, and an instant later Harry was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley. (Excuse me, what? said his brain.) (We just teleported, explained Harry.) (That didn’t used to happen in the ancestral environment, Harry’s brain com- plained, and disoriented him.) Harry staggered as his feet adjusted to the brick of the street instead of the dirt of the forest corridor they had been traversing. He straightened, still dizzy, with the bustling witches and wizards seeming to sway slightly, and the cries of the shopkeepers seeming to move around in his hearing, as his brain tried to place a world to be located in. Moments later, there was a sort of sucking-popping sound from a few paces behind Harry, and when Harry turned to look Professor Quirrell was there. “Do you mind—” said Harry, at the same time as Professor Quirrell said, “I’m afraid I—” Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn’t. “—need to go off and set something in motion, Mr Potter. As it has been thoroughly explained to me that I am responsible for anything what- soever that happens to you, I’ll be leaving you with—” “News-stand,” Harry said. “Pardon?” “Or anywhere I can buy a copy of the Daily Prophet. Put me there and I’ll be happy.” Shortly after, Harry had been delivered into a bookshop, accompanied by several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And the shopkeeper had received less ambiguous threats, judging by the way he had cringed, and how his eyes now kept darting between Harry and the entrance. If the bookshop burned down, Harry was going to stick around in the middle of the fire until Professor Quirrell got back. Meanwhile— Harry took a quick glance around. The bookshop seemed rather small and shoddy, with only four rows of bookcases visible, and the nearest shelf Harry’s eyes had jumped to seemed to deal with narrow, cheaply bound books with grim titles like The Massacre of Albania in the Fifteenth Century. First things first. Harry stepped over to the seller’s counter. “Pardon me,” said Harry, “One copy of the Daily Prophet, please.” “Five Sickles,” said the shopkeeper. “Sorry, kid, I’ve only got three left.” Five Sickles dropped onto the counter. Harry had the feeling he could have bargained him down a couple of points, but at this point he didn’t really care. The shopkeeper’s eyes widened and he seemed to really notice Harry for the first time. “You!” “Me!” “Is it true? Are you really—” “Shut up! Sorry, I’ve been waiting all day to read this in the original newspaper instead of hearing about it second hand, so please just hand it over, all right?” The shopkeeper stared at Harry for a moment, then wordlessly reached under the counter and passed over one folded copy of the Daily Prophet. The headline read: Harry Potter Secretly Betrothed To Ginevra Weasley Harry stared. He lifted the newspaper off the counter, softly, reverently, like he was handling an original Escher artwork, and unbent it to read… …about the evidence that had convinced Rita Skeeter. …and some interesting further details. …and yet more evidence. Fred and George had cleared it with their sister first, surely? Yes, of course they had. There was a picture of Ginevra Weasley sighing longingly over what Harry could see, looking closely, was a photo of himself. That had to have been staged. But how on Earth…? Harry was sitting in a cheap folding chair, rereading the newspaper for the fourth time, when the door whispered softly and Professor Quirrell came back into the shop. “My apologies for—what in Merlin’s name are you reading?” “It would seem,” said Harry, awe in his voice, “that one Mr Arthur Weasley was placed under the Imperius Curse by a Death Eater whom my father killed, thus creating a debt to House Potter, which my father de- manded be repaid by the hand in marriage of the recently born Ginevra Weasley. Do people actually do that sort of thing around here?” “How could Miss Skeeter possibly be fool enough to believe—” And Professor Quirrell’s voice cut off. Harry had been reading the newspaper held vertically and unfolded, which meant that Professor Quirrell, from where he was standing, could see the text underneath the headline. The look of shock on Professor Quirrell’s face was a work of art almost on par with the newspaper itself. “Don’t worry,” said Harry cheerfully, “it’s all fake.” From elsewhere in the store, he heard the shopkeeper gasp. There was the sound of a stack of books falling over. “Mr Potter…” Professor Quirrell said slowly, “are you sure of that?” “Quite sure. Shall we go?” Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, and Harry folded the newspaper back up, and followed him out of the door. For some reason Harry didn’t seem to be hearing any street noises now. They walked in silence for thirty seconds before Professor Quirrell spoke. “Miss Skeeter viewed the original proceedings of the restricted Wizengamot session.” “Yes.” “The original proceedings of the Wizengamot.” “Yes.” “I would have trouble doing that.” “Really?” said Harry. “Because if my suspicions are correct, this was done by a Hogwarts student.” “That is beyond impossible,” Professor Quirrell said flatly. “Mr Potter… I regret to say that this young lady expects to marry you.” “But that is improbable,” said Harry. “To quote Douglas Adams, the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks.” “I see your point,” Professor Quirrell said slowly. “But…no, Mr Potter. It may be impossible, but I can imagine tampering with the Wizengamot proceedings. It is unimaginable that the Grand Manager of Gringotts should affix the seal of his office in witness to a false betrothal contract, and Miss Skeeter personally verified that seal.” “Indeed,” said Harry, “you would expect the Grand Manager of Gringotts to get involved with that much money changing hands. It seems Mr Weasley was greatly in debt, and so demanded an additional payment of ten thousand Galleons—” “Ten thousand Galleons for a Weasley? You could buy the daughter of a Noble House for that!” “Excuse me,” Harry said. “I really have to ask at this point, do people actually do that sort of thing around here—” “Rarely,” said Professor Quirrell, with a frown on his face. “And not at all, I suspect, since the Dark Lord departed. I suppose that according to the newspaper, your father just paid it?” “He didn’t have any choice,” said Harry. “Not if he wanted to fulfil the conditions of the prophecy.” “Give me that,” said Professor Quirrell, and the newspaper leaped out of Harry’s hand so fast that he got a paper cut. Harry automatically put the finger in his mouth to suck on, feeling rather shocked, and turned to remonstrate with Professor Quirrell— Professor Quirrell had stopped short in the middle of the street, and his eyes were flickering rapidly back and forth as an invisible force held the newspaper suspended before him. Harry watched, gaping in open awe, as the newspaper opened to re- veal pages two and three. And not much long after, four and five. It was like the man had cast off a pretence of mortality. And after a troublingly short time, the paper neatly folded itself up again. Professor Quirrell plucked it from the air and tossed it to Harry, who caught it in sheer reflex; and then Professor Quirrell started walking again, and Harry automatically trudged after. “No,” said Professor Quirrell, “that prophecy didn’t sound quite right to me either.” Harry nodded, still stunned. “The centaurs could have been put under an Imperius,” Professor Quirrell said, frowning, “that seems understandable. What magic can make, magic can corrupt, and it is not unthinkable that the Great Seal of Gringotts could be twisted to another’s hand. The Unspeakable could have been impersonated with Polyjuice, likewise the Bavarian seer. And with enough effort it might be possible to tamper with the proceedings of the Wizengamot. Do you have any idea how that was done?” “I do not have one single plausible hypothesis,” said Harry. “I do know it was done on a total budget of forty Galleons.” Professor Quirrell stopped short and whirled on Harry. His expres- sion was now completely incredulous. “Forty Galleons will pay a compe- tent ward-breaker to open a path into a home you wish to burgle! Forty thousand Galleons might pay a team of the greatest professional criminals in the world to tamper with the proceedings of the Wizengamot!” Harry shrugged helplessly. “I’ll remember that the next time I want to save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty Galleons by finding the right contractor.” “I do not say this often,” said Professor Quirrell. “I am impressed.” “Likewise,” said Harry. “And who is this incredible Hogwarts student?” “I’m afraid I couldn’t say.” Somewhat to Harry’s surprise, Professor Quirrell made no objection to this. They walked in the direction of the Gringotts building, thinking, for they were neither of them the sort of person who would give up on the problem without considering it for at least five minutes. “I have a feeling,” Harry said finally, “that we’re coming at this from the wrong angle. There’s a tale I once heard about some students who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them a large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal plate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler, and the metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your guess for why this happens. So some stu- dents wrote down ‘because of how the metal conducts heat’, and some students wrote down ‘because of how the air moves’, and no-one said ‘this just seems impossible’, and the real answer was that before the students came into the room, the teacher turned the plate around.” “Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell. “That does sound similar. Is there a moral?” “That your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality,” said Harry. “If you’re equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge. The students thought they could use words like ‘because of heat conduction’ to explain anything, even a metal plate being cooler on the side nearer the fire. So they didn’t notice how confused they were, and that meant they couldn’t be more confused by falsehood than by truth. If you tell me that the centaurs were under the Imperius Curse, I still have the feeling of something being not quite right. I notice that I’m still confused even after hearing your explanation.” “Hm,” said Professor Quirrell. They walked on further. “I don’t suppose,” said Harry, “that it’s possible to actually swap peo- ple into alternate universes? Like, this isn’t our own Rita Skeeter, or they temporarily sent her somewhere else?” “If that was possible,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice rather dry, “would I still be here?” And just as they were almost to the huge white front of the Gringotts building, Professor Quirrell said: “Ah. Of course. I see it now. Let me guess, the Weasley twins?” “What?” said Harry, his voice rising an octave. “How?” “I’m afraid I couldn’t say.” “…That is not fair.” “I think it is extremely fair,” said Professor Quirrell, and they entered through the bronze doors. 441 CH APTER 2 6 442 NOTICING CONFUSION 443 CH APTER 2 6 444 NOTICING CONFUSION 445 CH APTER 2 6 446 NOTICING CONFUSION 447 CH APTER 2 6 448 NOTICING CONFUSION 449 451 CH APTER 27 452 EMPATH Y Harry was in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid black. The room was screened against detection, and the man had per- formed exactly twenty-seven spells before saying so much as “Hello, Mr Potter.” It was oddly appropriate that the man in black was about to try read- ing Harry’s mind. “Prepare yourself,” the man said tonelessly. A human mind, Harry’s Occlumency book had said, was only exposed to a Legilimens along certain surfaces. If you failed to defend your sur- faces, the Legilimens would go through and be able to access any part of you which their own mind was able to comprehend… …which tended not to be much. Human minds, it seemed, were hard for humans to understand on any level but the shallowest. Harry had won- dered if knowing lots of cognitive science could make him an incredibly powerful Legilimens, but repeated experience had finally driven into him the lesson that he needed to get a little less excited in his anticipations about this sort of thing. It wasn’t as if any cognitive scientist understood humans well enough to make one. To learn the counter, Occlumency, the first step was to imagine your- self to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly as you could, im- mersing yourself entirely in that alternate persona. You wouldn’t always have to do that, but in the beginning, it was how you learned where your surfaces were. The Legilimens would try to read you, and you would feel it happening if you paid close enough attention, you would sense them trying to enter. And your job was to make sure that they always touched your imaginary persona and not the real one. When you were good enough at that, you could imagine being a very simple sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make a habit of leaving the pretence in place where all your surfaces were. That was a standard Occlu- mency barrier. Pretending to be a rock was hard to learn, but easy to do afterwards, and the exposed surface of a mind was much shallower than its interior, so with enough practice you could keep it up as a background habit. Or if you were a perfect Occlumens, you could race ahead of any probes, answering queries as fast as they were asked, so that the Legilimens would enter through your surfaces and see a mind indistinguishable from who- ever you were pretending to be. Even the best Legilimens could be fooled that way. If a perfect Occlu- mens claimed they were dropping their Occlumency barriers, there was no way to know if they were lying. Worse, you might not know you were dealing with a perfect Occlumens. They were rare, but the fact that they existed meant you couldn’t trust Legilimency on anyone. It was a sad commentary on how little human beings understood each other, how little any wizard comprehended the depths lying beneath the mind’s surface, that you could fool the best human telepaths by pretend- ing to be someone else. But then human beings only understood each other in the first place by pretending. You didn’t make predictions about people by modelling the hundred trillion synapses in their brain as separate objects. Ask the best social manipulator on Earth to build you an Artificial Intelligence from scratch, and they’d just give you a dumb look. You predicted peo- ple by telling your brain to act like theirs. You put yourself in their place. If you wanted to know what an angry person would do, you activated your own brain’s anger circuitry, and whatever that circuitry output, that was your prediction. What did the neural circuitry for anger actually look like inside? Who knew? The best social manipulator on Earth might not know what neurons were, and neither might the best Legilimens. Anything a Legilimens could understand, an Occlumens could pretend to be. It was the same trick either way—probably implemented by the same neural circuitry in both cases, a single set of control circuits for re- configuring your own brain to act as a model of someone else’s. And so the race between telepathic offense and telepathic defence had been a decisive win for defence. Otherwise the entire magical world, maybe even the whole Earth, would have been a very different place… Harry took a deep breath, and concentrated. There was a slight smile on his face. For once, just once, Harry hadn’t been short-changed in the mysterious powers department. After almost a month of work, and more on a whim than any real hunch, Harry had decided to make himself coldly angry and then try the book’s Occlumency exercises again. At that point he’d mostly given up hope on that sort of thing, but it had still seemed worth a quick try— He’d run through all the book’s hardest exercises in two hours, and the next day he’d gone and told Professor Quirrell he was ready. His dark side, it had turned out, was very, very good at pretending to be other people. Harry thought of his standard trigger, from the first time he’d gone over entirely to his dark side… Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. “And that will be…five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.” Harry’s smile grew chillier, and he regarded the black-robed man who thought he was going to read Harry’s mind. And then Harry turned into someone else entirely, someone who had seemed appropriate to the occasion. …in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a desk, fac- ing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid black. Kimball Kinnison regarded the black-robed man who thought he was going to read the mind of a Second-Stage Lensman of the Galactic Patrol. To say that Kimball Kinnison was confident of the outcome would be an understatement. He had been trained by Mentor of Arisia, the most powerful mind known to this or any other universe, and the mere wiz- ard sitting across from him would see precisely what the Gray Lensman wanted him to see… …the mind of the boy he was currently disguised as, an innocent child named Harry Potter. “I’m ready,” said Kimball Kinnison in nervous tones that were exactly appropriate for an eleven-year-old boy. “Legilimens,” said the black-robed wizard. There was a pause. The black-robed wizard blinked, as if he’d seen something so shocking that it had been enough to make even his eyelids move. His voice wasn’t quite toneless as he said, “The Boy-Who-Lived has a mysterious dark side?” The heat slowly crept up into Harry’s cheeks. “Well,” the man said. His face had now settled back into perfect calm. “Excuse me. Mr Potter, it is good to know your advantages, but that is not the same as being wildly overconfident in them. You may indeed be able to learn Occlumency at eleven years of age. This astounds me. I had thought Mr Dumbledore was pretending to be insane again. Your dissociative tal- ent is so strong that I am surprised to find no other signs of childhood abuse, and you may become a perfect Occlumens in time. But there is a considerable difference between that and expecting to put up a successful Occlumency barrier on your first attempt. That is merely ridiculous. Did you feel anything as I read your mind?” Harry shook his head, now blushing furiously. “Then pay closer attention next time. The goal is not to create a perfect image on your first day of lessons. The goal is to learn where your surfaces are. Prepare yourself.” Harry tried to pretend to be Kimball Kinnison again, tried to pay more attention, but his thoughts were a little scattered and he was suddenly aware of all the things he shouldn’t be thinking about… Oh, this was going to suck. Harry gritted his teeth. At least the instructor would be Obliviated af- terwards. “Legilimens.” There was a pause— 457 CH APTER 27 Harry was in a rather bad mood as he stomped out of his Herbology class the next Monday morning. Hermione was seething alongside him. The other children were still inside, a bit slow to assemble their things because they were gibbering excitedly to each other about Ravenclaw win- ning the year’s second Quidditch match. It seemed that last night after dinner, a girl had flown around on a broomstick for thirty minutes and then caught some sort of giant mosquito. There were other facts about what had happened during this match, but they were irrelevant. Harry had missed this exciting sports event due to his Occlumency lesson, and also having a life. He had then avoided all conversations in the Ravenclaw dorm, weren’t Quieting Charms and magical trunks wonderful. He had eaten breakfast at the Gryffindor table. But Harry couldn’t avoid Herbology, and the Ravenclaws had talked about it before class, and after class, and during class, until Harry had looked up from the baby furcot whose diaper he was changing, and announced loudly that some of them were trying to learn about plants and Snitches didn’t grow on anything so could they all please shut up about Quidditch. Everyone else present had given him shocked looks, ex- cept Hermione, who’d looked like she wanted to applaud, and Professor Sprout, who had awarded him a point for Ravenclaw. A point for Ravenclaw. One point. The seven idiots on their idiot brooms playing their idiot game had earned one hundred and ninety points for Ravenclaw. It seemed that Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total. In other words, catching a golden mosquito was worth 150 House points. Harry couldn’t even imagine what he would have to do to earn one hun- dred and fifty House points. Besides, y’know, rescuing a hundred and fifty Hufflepuffs, or coming up with fifteen ideas as good as putting protective shells on time machines, or invent- ing one thousand five hundred creative ways to kill people, or being Hermione Granger for the entire year. “We should kill them,” Harry said to Hermione, who was walking be- side him with an equally offended air. “Who?” said Hermione. “The Quidditch team?” “I was thinking of everyone involved in any way with Quidditch any- where, but the Ravenclaw team would be a start, yes.” Hermione’s lips were pursed disapprovingly. “You do know that killing people is wrong, Harry?” “Yes,” Harry said. “Okay, just checking,” Hermione said. “Let’s get the Seeker first. I’ve read some Agatha Christie mysteries, do you know how we can get her onto a train?” “Two students plotting murder,” said a dry voice. “How shocking.” From around a nearby corner strolled a man in lightly spotted robes, his greasy hair falling long and unkempt about his shoulders. Deadly dan- ger seemed to radiate out from him, filling the hallway with improperly mixed potions and accidental falls and people dying in bed of what the Aurors would rule to be natural causes. Without thinking about it at all, Harry stepped in front of Hermione. There was an intake of breath from behind him, and then a moment later Hermione brushed past and stepped in front of him. “Run, Harry!” she said. “Boys shouldn’t have to be in danger.” Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. “Amusing. I request a moment of your time, Potter, if you can tear yourself away from your flirtations with Miss Granger.” Suddenly there was a very worried look on Hermione’s face. She turned to Harry and opened her mouth, then paused, looking distressed. “Oh, don’t worry, Miss Granger,” said Severus’s silky voice. “I promise to return your beau unmaimed.” His smile vanished. “Now Potter and I are about to go off and have a private conversation, just by ourselves. I hope it is clear that you are not invited, but just in case, consider that an order from a Hogwarts professor. I’m sure a good little girl like you won’t disobey.” And Severus turned and walked back around the corner. “Coming, Potter?” his voice said. “Um,” Harry said to Hermione. “Can I just sort of go off and follow him and let you work out what I should say to make sure you’re not all worried and offended?” “No,” Hermione said, her voice trembling. Severus’s laughter echoed from around the corner. Harry bowed his head. “Sorry,” he said quietly, “really,” and he went off after the Potions Master. 460 EMPATH Y 461 CH APTER 27 462 EMPATH Y 463 CH APTER 27 There is a main hallway running through the middle of Hogwarts’s second floor on the north-south axis, and near the centre of this hallway there is an opening into a short corridor which goes a dozen paces back before turning at a right angle, making an L-shape, and then goes a dozen paces more before it ends at a bright, wide window, looking out from three stories above upon the light drizzle falling over the east grounds of Hogwarts. Standing by the window you can hear nothing of the main hall- way, and no-one in the hallway would hear what went on by the window. If you think there is anything odd about this, you haven’t been in Hogwarts very long. Four boys in red-trimmed robes are laughing, and a boy in green- trimmed robes is screaming and grabbing frantically onto the edges of the opened window with his hands, as the four boys make as though to push him out. It’s just a joke, of course, and besides, a fall from that height wouldn’t kill a wizard. All good fun. If you think there is anything odd about this— “What are you doing?” says a sixth boy’s voice. The four boys in red-trimmed robes spin around with sudden starts, and the boy in green-trimmed robes frantically pushes himself away from the window and falls to the floor, face streaked with tears. “Oh,” says the most handsome of the boys in red-trimmed robes, sounding relieved, “it’s you. Hey, Lessy, you know who this is?” There isn’t any answer from the boy on the floor, who’s trying to get his sniffling under control, and the boy in the red-trimmed robes draws back his leg for a kick— “Stop it!” shouts the sixth boy. The boy in the red-trimmed robes wobbles as he aborts the kick. “Um,” he says, “do you know who this is?” The sixth boy’s breathing sounds strange. “Lesath Lestrange,” he says, his breath coming in short pants, “and he didn’t do anything to my parents, he was five years old.” 465 CH APTER 27 466 EMPATH Y 467 CH APTER 27 468 EMPATH Y 469 CH APTER 27 470 EMPATH Y 471 CH APTER 27 Harry watched Neville leave. Of course Harry hadn’t said what the solution was. The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God. Neville’s footsteps moved off, and soon could no longer be heard. And then there was one. “Ahem,” said Severus Snape’s voice from directly behind him. Harry let out a small scream and instantly hated himself. Slowly, Harry turned around. The tall greasy man in the spotted robes was leaning against the wall in the same position Harry had occupied. “A fine invisibility cloak, Potter,” drawled the Potions Master. “Much is explained.” Oh, bloody crap. “And perhaps I have been in Dumbledore’s company too long,” said Severus, “but I cannot help but wonder if that is the Cloak of Invisibility.” Harry immediately turned into someone who’d never heard of the Cloak of Invisibility and who was exactly as smart as Harry thought Severus thought Harry was. “Oh, possibly,” said Harry. “I trust you realize the implications, if it is?” Severus’s voice was condescending. “You have no idea what I’m talk- ing about, do you, Potter? A rather clumsy try at fishing.” (Professor Quirrell had remarked over their lunch that Harry really needed to conceal his state of mind better than putting on a blank face when someone discussed a dangerous topic, and had explained about one-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, and so on. So either Severus was in fact modelling Harry as a one-level player, which made Severus himself two-level, and Harry’s three-level move had been successful; or Severus was a four-level player and wanted Harry to think the deception had been successful. Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level he played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had responded, One level higher than you.) “So you were watching this whole time,” said Harry. “Disillusionment, I think it’s called.” A thin smile. “It would have been foolish of me to take the slightest risk that you came to harm.” “And you wanted to see the results of your test first hand,” said Harry. “So. Am I like my father?” A strange sad expression came over the man, one that looked foreign to his face. “I should sooner say, Harry Potter, that you resemble—” Severus stopped short. He stared at Harry. “Lestrange called you a son of a mudblood,” Severus said slowly. “It didn’t seem to bother you much.” Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Not under those circumstances, no.” “You’d just helped him,” Severus said. His eyes were intent on Harry. “And he threw it back in your face. Surely that isn’t something you’d just forgive?” “He’d just been through a pretty harrowing experience,” Harry said. “And I don’t think being rescued by first-years helped his pride much, ei- ther.” “I suppose it was easy enough to forgive,” Severus said, and his voice was odd, “since Lestrange means nothing to you. Just some strange Sly- therin. If it was a friend, perhaps, you would have felt far more injured by what he said.” “If he were a friend,” Harry said, “all the more reason to forgive him.” There was a long silence. Harry felt, and he couldn’t have said why or from where, that the air was filling up with a dreadful tension, like water rising, and rising, and rising. Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed once more, and all the tension vanished. “You are a very forgiving person,” Severus said, still smiling. “I sup- pose your stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, was the one who taught it to you.” “More like Dad’s science-fiction and fantasy collection,” said Harry. “Sort of my fifth parent, really. I’ve lived the lives of all the characters in all my books, and all their mighty wisdom thunders in my head. Somewhere in there was someone like Lesath, I expect, though I couldn’t say who. It wasn’t hard to put myself in his shoes. And it was my books that told me what to do about it, too. The good guys forgive.” Severus gave a light, amused laugh. “I’m afraid I wouldn’t know much about what good people do.” Harry looked at him. That was kind of sad, actually. “I’ll lend you some novels with good people in them, if you like.” “I should like to ask your advice about something,” Severus said, his voice casual. “I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who was being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful Muggle-born girl, who came across him being bullied, and tried to rescue him. And he called her a mud- blood, and that was the end for them. He apologized, many times, but she never forgave him. Have you any thoughts for what he could have said or done, to win from her the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?” “Erm,” Harry said, “based on only that information, I’m not sure he was the main one who had a problem. I’d have told him not to date some- one that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they’d married, can you imag- ine life in that household?” There was a pause. “Oh, but she could forgive,” Severus said with amusement in his voice. “Why, afterwards, she went off and became the girlfriend of the bully. Tell me, why would she forgive the bully, and not the bullied?” Harry shrugged. “At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt someone else very badly, and the bullied had hurt her just a little, and to her that just felt far more unforgivable somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it, was the bully handsome? Or for that matter, rich?” There was another pause. “Yes to both,” said Severus. “And there you have it,” said Harry. “Not that I’ve ever been through high school myself, but my books give me to understand that there’s a certain kind of teenage girl who’ll be outraged by a single insult if the boy is plain or poor, yet who can somehow find room in her heart to forgive a rich and handsome boy his bullying. She was shallow, in other words. Tell whoever it was that she wasn’t worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty.” Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The smile had faded, and though Severus’s face twitched, it did not return. Harry was starting to feel a bit nervous. “Um, not that I’ve got any experience in the area myself, obviously, but I think that’s what a wise adviser from my books would say.” There was more silence and more glittering. It was probably a good time to change the subject. “So,” Harry said. “Did I pass your test, whatever it was?” “I think,” Severus said, “that there should be no more conversations between us, Potter, and you would be exceedingly wise never to speak of this one.” Harry blinked. “Would you mind telling me what I did wrong?” “You offended me,” said Severus. “And I no longer trust your cunning.” Harry stared at Severus, taken rather aback. “But you have given me well-meant advice,” said Severus Snape, “and so I will give you true advice in return.” His voice was almost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly horizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by a million tons of tension pulling at either end. “You almost died today, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone unless you know exactly what you are both talking about.” Harry’s mind finally made the connection. “You were that—” Harry’s mouth snapped shut as the almost died part sank in, two sec- onds too late. “Yes,” said Severus, “I was.” And the terrible tension flooded back into the room like water pres- surized at the bottom of the ocean. Harry couldn’t breathe. Lose. Now. “I didn’t know,” Harry whispered. “I’m s—” “No,” said Severus. Just that one word. Harry stood there in silence, his mind frantically searching for op- tions. Severus stood between him and the window, which was a real pity, because a fall from that height wouldn’t kill a wizard. “Your books betrayed you, Potter,” said Severus, still in that voice stretched tight by a million tons of pull. “They did not tell you the one thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from stories what it is like to lose the one you love. That is something you could never understand without feeling it yourself.” “My father,” Harry whispered. It was his best guess, the one thing that might save him. “My father tried to protect you from the bullies.” A ghastly smile stretched across Severus’s face, and the man moved toward Harry. And past him. “Goodbye, Potter,” said Severus, not looking back on his way out. “We shall have little to say to each other from today on.” And at the corner, the man stopped, and without turning, spoke one final time. “Your father was the bully,” said Severus Snape, “and what your mother saw in him was something I never did understand until this day.” He left. Harry turned and walked toward the window. His shaking hands went onto the ledge. Never give anyone wise advice unless you know exactly what you’re both talk- ing about. Got it. Harry stared out at the clouds and the light drizzle for a while. The window looked out on the east grounds, and it was afternoon, so if the sun was visible through the clouds at all, Harry couldn’t see it. His hands had stopped shaking, but there was a tight feeling in Harry’s chest, like it was being compressed by metal bands. So his father had been a bully. And his mother had been shallow. Maybe they’d grown up later. Good people like Professor McGonagall did seem to think the world of them, and it might not be only because they were heroic martyrs. Of course, that was scant consolation when you were eleven and about to turn into a teenager, and wondering what sort of teenager you might become. So very terrible. So very sad. Such an awful life Harry led. Learning that his genetic parents hadn’t been perfect, why, he ought to spend awhile moping about that, feeling sorry for himself. Maybe he could complain to Lesath Lestrange. Harry had read about Dementors. Cold and darkness surrounded them, and fear, they sucked away all your happy thoughts and in that absence all your worst memories rose to the surface. He could imagine himself in Lesath’s shoes, knowing that his parents were in Azkaban for life, that place from which no-one had ever escaped. And Lesath would be imagining himself in his mother’s place, in the cold and the darkness and the fear, alone with all of her worst memories, even in her dreams, every second of every day. For an instant Harry imagined his own Mum and Dad in Azkaban with the Dementors sucking out their life, draining away the happy memories of their love for him. Just for an instant, before his imagination blew a fuse and called an emergency shutdown and told him never to imagine that again. Was it right to do that to anyone, even the second most evil person in the world? No, said the wisdom of Harry’s books, not if there’s any other way, any other way at all. And unless the wizarding justice system was as perfect as their prisons—and that sounded rather improbable, all things considered— somewhere in Azkaban was a person who was entirely innocent, and probably more than one. There was a burning sensation in Harry’s throat, and moisture gath- ering in his eyes, and he wanted to teleport all of Azkaban’s prisoners to safety and call down fire from the sky and blast that terrible place down to bedrock. But he couldn’t, because he wasn’t God. And Harry remembered what Professor Quirrell had said beneath the starlight: Sometimes, when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been…But the stars are so very, very far away…And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a long, long time. Right now this flawed world seemed unusually hateful. And Harry couldn’t understand Professor Quirrell’s words, it might have been an alien that had spoken, or an Artificial Intelligence, some- thing built along such different lines from Harry that his brain couldn’t be forced to operate in that mode. You couldn’t leave your home planet while it still contained a place like Azkaban. You had to stay and fight. CHAPTER TWENT Y-EIGHT RE DUCTIONISM “Okay,” Harry said, swallowing. “Okay, Hermione, it’s enough, you can stop.” The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn’t changed shape or colour at all, even though she was concentrating harder than Harry had ever seen, her eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on her forehead, hand trembling as it gripped the wand— “Hermione, stop! It’s not going to work, Hermione, I don’t think we can make things that don’t exist yet!” Slowly, Hermione’s hand relaxed its grasp on the wand. “I thought I felt it,” she said in a bare whisper. “I thought I felt it start to Transfigure, just for a second.” There was a lump in Harry’s throat. “You were probably imagining it. Hoping too hard.” “I probably was,” she said. She looked like she wanted to cry. Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and reached over to the sheet of paper with all the items crossed out, and drew a line through the item that said ‘ALZHEIMER’S CURE’. They couldn’t have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But Transfigu- ration, at least the kind they could do, didn’t enchant the targets—it wouldn’t Transfigure a regular broomstick into a flying one. So if Hermi- one had been able to make a pill at all, it would have been a non-magical pill, one that worked for ordinary material reasons. They could have se- cretly made pills for a Muggle science lab, let them study the pills and try to reverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off…no-one in either world would need to know that magic had been involved, it would just be another scientific breakthrough… It hadn’t been the sort of thing a wizard would think of, either. They didn’t respect mere patterns of atoms that much, they didn’t think of unen- chanted material things as objects of power. If it wasn’t magical, it wasn’t interesting. Earlier, Harry had very secretly—he hadn’t even told Hermione—tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler. (He’d tried to produce a desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny self-replicating assemblers, Harry wasn’t insane.) It would have been godhood in a single shot if it’d worked. “That was it for today, right?” said Hermione. She was slumped back in her chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face showed her tiredness, which was very unusual for Hermione. She liked to pretend she was limitless, at least when Harry was around. “One more,” Harry said cautiously, “but that one’s small, plus it might actually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we could end on an up note. It’s real stuff, not like phasers. They’ve already made it in the laboratory, not like the Alzheimer’s cure. And it’s a generic substance, not specific like the lost books you tried to Transfigure copies of. I made a diagram of the molecular structure to show you. We just want to make it longer than it’s ever been made before, and with all the tubes aligned, and the endpoints embedded in diamond.” Harry produced a sheet of graph paper. Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. “These are all carbon atoms? And Harry, what’s the name? I can’t Transfigure it if I don’t know what it’s called.” Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting used to that sort of thing, it shouldn’t matter what something was named if you knew what it was. “They’re called buckytubes, or carbon nanotubes. It’s a kind of fullerene that was discovered just this year. It’s about a hundred times stronger than steel and a sixth of the weight.” Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised. “That’s real?” “Yeah,” Harry said, “just hard to make the Muggle way. If we could get enough of the stuff, we could use it to build a space elevator all the way up to geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in terms of delta-v that’s halfway to anywhere in the Solar System. Plus we could throw out solar power satellites like confetti.” Hermione was frowning again. “Is this stuff safe?” “I don’t see why it wouldn’t be,” Harry said. “A buckytube is just a graphite sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and graphite is the same stuff used in pencils—” “I know what graphite is, Harry,” Hermione said. She brushed her hair back absent-mindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she stared at the sheet of paper. Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white thread tied to two small grey plastic rings at either end. He’d added drops of su- perglue where the thread met either ring, to make it all a single object that could be Transfigured as a whole. Cyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked by covalent bonds, and that was as close to being a “solid object” as you ever got in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. “When you’re ready,” Harry said, “try to Transfigure this into a set of aligned buckytube fibres embedded in two solid diamond rings.” “All right…” Hermione said slowly. “Harry, I feel like I just missed something.” Harry shrugged helplessly. Maybe you’re just tired. He knew better than to say it out loud, though. Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for a while. Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table, connected by a long black thread. “It changed,” said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to be enthusiastic but had run out of energy. “Now what?” Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner’s lack of passion, but did his best not to show it; maybe the same process would work in reverse to cheer her up. “Now I test it to see if it holds weight.” There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier experiment with diamond rods—you could make solid diamond objects easily, using Transfiguration, they just wouldn’t last. The earlier experiment had mea- sured whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod into a shorter diamond rod would allow it to lift a suspended heavy weight as it contracted, i.e., could you Transfigure against tension, which you in fact could. Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the thick metal hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal hanger to the bottom ring, and then started attaching weights to the hanger. (Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus for him, and the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look, like they couldn’t figure out what sort of prank he could possibly want that for, but they hadn’t asked any questions. And their Transfigurations, according to them, lasted for around three hours, so Harry and Hermione still had a while left.) “One hundred kilograms,” Harry said about a minute later. “I don’t think a steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go up much higher, but that’s all the weight I’ve got.” There was a further silence. Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat down in his chair, and ceremoniously made a check mark next to ‘Buckytubes’. “There,” Harry said. “That one worked.” “But it’s not really useful, Harry, is it?” Hermione said from where she was sitting with her head resting in her hands. “I mean, even if we gave it to a scientist they couldn’t learn how to make lots of buckytubes from studying ours.” “They might be able to learn something,” Harry said. “Hermione, look at it, that little tiny thread holding up all that weight, we just made some- thing that no Muggle laboratory could make—” “But any other witch could make it,” Hermione said. Her exhaustion was coming into her voice, now. “Harry, I don’t think this is working out.” “You mean our relationship?” Harry said. “Great! Let’s break up.” That got a slight grin out of her. “I mean our research.” “Oh, Hermione, how could you?” “You’re sweet when you’re mean,” she said. “But Harry, this is nuts, I’m twelve, you’re eleven, it’s silly to think we’re going to discover anything that no-one’s ever figured out before.” “Are you really saying we should give up on unravelling the secrets of magic after trying for less than one month?” Harry said, trying to put a note of challenge into his voice. Honestly he was feeling some of the same fatigue as Hermione. None of the good ideas ever worked. He’d made just one discovery worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn’t tell Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco. “No,” Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious and adult. “I’m saying right now we should be studying all the magic that wiz- ards already know, so we can do this sort of thing after we graduate from Hogwarts.” “Um…” Harry said. “Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but imagine we’d decided to hold off on research until later, and the first thing we tried after we graduated was Transfiguring an Alzheimer’s cure, and it worked. We’d feel…I don’t think the word stupid would adequately describe how we’d feel. What if there’s something else like that and it does work?” “That’s not fair, Harry!” Hermione said. Her voice was trembling like she was on the verge of breaking out crying. “You can’t put that on people! It’s not our job to do that sort of thing, we’re kids!” For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone told Hermione she had to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn into one of the whiny self-pitying heroes that Harry could never stand reading about in his books. “Anyway,” Hermione said. Her voice shook. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I don’t believe children can do things that grown-ups can’t, that’s only in stories.” There was silence in the classroom. Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that his own expression had cooled. It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn’t already come to Harry—that, while thirty might be old for a scientific revolution- ary and twenty about right, while there were people who got doctorates when they were seventeen and fourteen-year-old heirs who’d been great kings or generals, there wasn’t really anyone who’d made the history books at eleven. “All right,” Harry said. “Figure out how to do something a grown-up can’t. Is that your challenge?” “I didn’t mean it like that,” Hermione said, her voice coming out in a frightened whisper. With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. “I’m not angry at you,” Harry said. His voice was cold, despite his best efforts. “I’m angry at, I don’t know, everything. But I’m not willing to lose, Her- mione. Losing isn’t always the right thing to do. I’ll figure out how to do something a grown wizard can’t do, and then I’ll get back to you. How’s that?” There was more silence. “Okay,” said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed herself up out of her chair, and went over to the door of the abandoned classroom they’d been working in. Her hand went onto the doorknob. “We’re still friends, right? And if you can’t figure out anything—” Her voice halted. “Then we’ll study together,” Harry said. His voice was even colder now. “Um, bye for now, then,” Hermione said, and she quickly went out of the room and shut the door behind her. Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was inside it. And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as Her- mione, that no, children couldn’t do what grown-ups couldn’t, was saying all the things that Hermione had been too frightened to say, like, That’s one hell of a difficult challenge you just grabbed for yourself and boy are you going to end up with egg on your face this time and at least this way you’ll know you’ve failed. And the part of him that didn’t enjoy losing replied, in a very cold voice, Fine, you can shut up and watch. 484 RE DUCTIONISM Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy at the Ravenclaw table. Hermione’s lunch had two fruits (tomato slices and peeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots, and more carrots), one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose unhealthy coating she would carefully remove), and one little piece of chocolate cake that she would earn by eating the other parts. It hadn’t been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had night- mares about that. But this time she had made it happen and she’d felt like its target. Just for a moment, before the terrible cold darkness looked away and said it wasn’t angry with her, because it hadn’t wanted to scare her. And she still had that feeling like she’d missed something earlier, something really important. But they hadn’t violated any of the rules of Transfiguration…had they? They hadn’t made any liquids, any gases, they hadn’t taken orders from the Defence Professor… The pill! That had been something to be eaten! …well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it hadn’t worked actually, they could have just Finite Incantatemed it if it had, but she would still have to tell Harry about that and make sure they didn’t mention it in front of Professor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to study Transfiguration again… Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her stomach. She pushed back her plate from the table, she couldn’t eat lunch like this. And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules of Trans- figuration. “I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or gas.” “I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything else that goes inside a human body.” No, they really shouldn’t have tried to Transfigure the pill, or they should’ve at least realized…she’d been so caught up in Harry’s brilliant idea that she hadn’t thought… The sick feeling in Hermione’s stomach was getting worse. There was a feeling in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of recogni- tion, a perception about to invert itself, a young woman about to become a crone, a vase about to become two faces… And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration. 486 RE DUCTIONISM Mandy Brocklehurst paused with her fork on her way to her mouth. “Huh,” she said to Su Li, sitting across from the now-empty space beside her, “what got into Hermione?” 487 CH APTER 28 488 RE DUCTIONISM 489 CH APTER 28 49 0 RE DUCTIONISM Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the stone, breath coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing through her blood. Like a picture of a young woman turning into an old crone, like the cup becoming two faces. What had they been doing? What had they been doing? She came to the classroom and her fingers slipped on the doorknob at first, too sweaty, she grabbed harder and the door opened— —in a single flash of perception she saw Harry staring at a small pink rectangle on the table in front of him— —as a few paces away the tiny black thread, almost invisible from this distance, supported all that weight— “Harry get out of the classroom!” Pure shock crossed Harry’s face, and he stood up so fast he almost fell over, stopping only to grab the small pink rectangle from the table, and he tore out of the door, she’d already stepped aside, her wand was already in her hand coming up pointing at the thread— “Finite Incantatem!” And Hermione slammed the door shut again, just as the gigantic crash of a hundred kilograms of falling metal came from inside. She was panting, gasping for air, she’d run all the way here without stopping, she was soaked in sweat and her legs and thighs burned like living flames, she couldn’t have answered Harry’s questions for all the Galleons in the world. Hermione blinked, and realized that she had started to fall, and Harry had caught her, and was lowering her gently to sit on the floor. “…healthy…” she managed to whisper. “What?” said Harry, looking paler than she’d ever seen him. “…are you, feeling, healthy…” Harry started looking even more frightened as the question sank in. “I, I don’t think I have any symptoms—” Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “Good,” she whispered. “Catch, breath.” That took a while. Harry was still looking scared. That was good too, maybe it would teach him a lesson. Hermione reached into the pouch Harry had bought her, whispered “water” through her parched throat, took out the bottle and drank in great huge gulps. And then it was still a while before she could talk again. “We broke the rules, Harry,” she said in a hoarse voice. “We broke the rules.” “I…” Harry swallowed. “I still don’t see how, I’ve been thinking but—” “I asked if the Transfiguration was safe and you answered me!” There was a pause. “That’s it?” Harry said. She could have screamed. “Harry, don’t you get it?” she said. “It’s made out of tiny fibres, what if it unravelled, who knows what could go wrong, we didn’t ask Professor Mc- Gonagall! Don’t you see what we were doing? We were experimenting with Transfiguration. We were experimenting with Transfiguration!” There was another pause. “Right…” Harry said slowly. “That’s probably one of those things they don’t even bother telling you not to do because it’s too obvious. Don’t test brilliant new ideas for Transfiguration by yourselves in an unused class- room without consulting any professors.” “You could have got us killed, Harry!” Hermione knew it wasn’t fair, she’d made the mistake too, but she still felt angry at him, he always sounded so confident and that had dragged her unthinkingly along in his wake. “We could have spoiled Professor McGonagall’s perfect record!” “Yes,” said Harry, “let’s not tell her about this, shall we?” “We have to stop,” Hermione said. “We have to stop this or we’re going to get hurt. We’re too young, Harry, we can’t do this, not yet.” A weak grin crossed Harry’s face. “Um, you’re sort of wrong about that.” And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a bright metal patch on it. Hermione stared at it, puzzled. “Quantum mechanics wasn’t enough,” Harry said. “I had to go all the way down to timeless physics before it took. Had to see the wand as en- forcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead of changing anything over time—but I did it, Hermione, I saw past the illu- sion of objects, and I bet there’s not a single other wizard in the world who could have. Even if some Muggle-born knew about timeless formula- tions of quantum mechanics, it would just be a weird belief about strange distant quantum stuff, they wouldn’t see that it was reality, accept that the world they knew was just a hallucination. I Transfigured part of the eraser without changing the whole thing.” Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser. For a moment anger crossed Harry’s face, but he didn’t make any move to stop her. “Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione. “Check with Professor McGonagall before you try it again.” Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight. “And we still have to stop,” said Hermione. “Why?” said Harry. “Don’t you see what this means, Hermione? Wiz- ards don’t know everything! There’s too few of them, even fewer who know any science, they haven’t exhausted the low-hanging fruit—” “It’s not safe,” Hermione said. “If we can find out new things it’s even less safe! We’re too young! We made one big mistake already, next time we could just die!” Then Hermione flinched. Harry looked away from her, and started taking slow, deep breaths. “Please don’t try to do it alone, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice trem- bling. “Please.” Please don’t make me have to decide whether to tell Professor Flitwick. There was a long pause. “So you want us to study,” Harry said. She could tell he was trying to keep the anger out of his voice. “Just study.” Hermione wasn’t sure if she should say anything, but…“Like you stud- ied, um, timeless physics, right?” Harry looked back at her. “That thing you did,” Hermione said, her voice tentative, “it wasn’t be- cause of our experiments, right? You could do it because you’d read lots of books.” Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a frus- trated look on his face. “All right,” Harry said. “How about this. We study, and if I think of anything that seems really worth trying, we’ll try it after I ask a professor.” “Okay,” Hermione said. She didn’t fall over with relief, but only be- cause she was already sitting down. “Shall we get lunch?” Harry said cautiously. Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this time. She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing as her body screamed at her— Harry pointed his wand at her and said “Wingardium Leviosa.” Hermione blinked as the huge weight on her legs diminished to some- thing bearable. A smile flitted across Harry’s face. “You can lift something without be- ing able to Hover it completely,” he said. “Remember that experiment?” Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought to still be angry. And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling remark- ably and wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully kept his wand trained on her. He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the thought that counted. 495 CH APTER 28 496 RE DUCTIONISM 497 CH APTER 28 498 RE DUCTIONISM 499 CH APTER 28 “Albus,” Minerva said after the boy had gone, “how did you know to take Harry seriously? I would have thought his idea merely impossible!” The old wizard’s face turned grave. “The same reason it must be kept secret, Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if Harry made any such claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort knows not.” The words took a few seconds to sink in. And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did when she remembered. It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill Trelawney apply- ing for the position of Professor of Divination. The one with power to vanquish the dark lord approaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies, and the dark lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the dark lord knows not, and either must destroy all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world. Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice, didn’t seem to fit something like partial Transfiguration. “Perhaps not, then,” Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to explain. “I confess I had been hoping for something that would help in finding Voldemort’s horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it. But…” The old wiz- ard shrugged. “Prophecies are tricky things, Minerva, and it is best to take no chances. The smallest thing may prove decisive if it remains unex- pected.” “And what do you suppose he meant about Severus?” said Minerva. “There I have no idea,” sighed Dumbledore. “Unless Harry is making a move against Severus, and thought that an open question might be taken seriously where a direct allegation would be dismissed. And if that was indeed what happened, Harry correctly reasoned that I would not trust that it was so. Let us simply keep watch, without prejudice, as he asks.” Alissa Cornfoot’s eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon the Potions Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a tiny bronze bean and saying something about screaming puddles of human flesh. Ever since the start of this year she’d been having trouble listening in Potions. She kept staring at their awful, mean, greasy professor and fan- tasizing about special detentions. There was probably something really wrong with her but she just couldn’t seem to stop doing it— “Ow!” Alissa said then. Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa’s forehead. “Miss Cornfoot,” said the Potions Master, his voice cutting, “this is a delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will hurt your class- mates, not just yourself. See me after class.” The last four words didn’t help her any, but she tried harder, and man- aged to get through the day without melting anyone. After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to stand there meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped penitently be- hind her back, just in case, but some quiet instinct told her this might be a bad idea. So instead she just stood there with her face neutral, in a posture that was very proper for a young lady, and said, “Professor?” “Miss Cornfoot,” Snape said without looking up from the sheets he was grading, “I do not return your affections, I begin to find your stares disturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth. Is that quite clear?” “Yes,” said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed her, and she fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten lava. CHAPTER TWENT Y-NINE E GOCE NTRIC BIA S There’d been a sinking feeling in Hermione’s stomach lately, every time she heard the other students talking about her and Harry. She’d been in a shower stall this morning when she’d overheard a conver- sation between Morag and Padma that had been the last straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws. She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry with Harry Potter had been a terrible mistake. If she’d just stayed away from Harry Potter, she could have been Her- mione Granger, the brightest academic star of Hogwarts, who was earn- ing more points for Ravenclaw than anyone. She wouldn’t have been as famous as the Boy-Who-Lived, but she would have been famous for her- self. Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name hap- pened to be Hermione Granger. And worse, she had gone on a date with him. The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an ap- pealing idea at first. She’d read books like that, and if there was anyone in Hogwarts who was a candidate for the heroine’s love interest it was obviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous, sometimes scary… So she’d forced Harry into going on a date with her. And now she was his love interest. Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu. She’d been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn on the water, when she’d heard giggles coming from outside. And she’d heard Morag talking about how that Muggle-born girl probably wouldn’t fight hard enough to win against Ginevra Weasley, and Padma speculating that Harry Potter might decide he wanted both. It was like they didn’t understand that girls had options on their dinner menu and boys fought over them. But that wasn’t even the part that hurt, really. It was that when she scored 98 on one of Professor McGonagall’s tests, the news wasn’t that Hermione Granger had scored the highest in the class, the news was that Harry Potter’s rival had scored seven more points than him. If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of his story. You didn’t get your own. And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk away, but that would’ve been too sad. But she did want to get back what she’d accidentally given away by let- ting herself become known as Harry’s rival. She wanted to be a separate person again instead of Harry Potter’s third leg, was that too much to ask? It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter how high you scored in class, even if you did something that deserved a special din- ner time announcement, it just meant you were rivalling Harry Potter again. But she thought she’d come up with a way. Something to do that wouldn’t be seen as pushing up on the opposite end of Harry Potter’s see-saw. It would be hard. It would go against her nature. She would have to fight someone very evil. And she would need to ask someone even more evil for help. Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door. She hesitated. Hermione realized she was being silly, and raised her hand a bit higher. She tried to knock again. Her hand quite failed to touch the door. And then the door swung open anyway. “Dear me,” said the spider, sitting in its web. “Was it really that hard to lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?” Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing pink. It had been. “Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful,” said the evil Professor Quir- rell. “Consider it already lost. There, I have taken a hard choice from you. Are you not grateful?” “Professor Quirrell,” Hermione managed to say in a voice that squeaked a little. “I have a lot of Quirrell points, don’t I?” “You do indeed,” said Professor Quirrell. “Though one less than you had before. Terrible, isn’t it? Just think, if I don’t like your reason for com- ing here, you could lose another fifty. Maybe I’d take them away one…by one…by one…” Hermione’s cheeks were going even redder. “You’re really evil, did any- one ever tell you that?” “Miss Granger,” Professor Quirrell said gravely, “it can be dangerous to give people compliments like that when they have not been truly earned. The recipient might feel bashful and undeserving and want to do some- thing worthy of your praise. Now what was it you wanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?” 505 CH APTER 2 9 506 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S 507 CH APTER 2 9 508 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff study hall with Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor Flitwick, surpris- ingly diffident for a teacher, had asked if she might possibly maybe help those four with their Charms homework for a while, even though they weren’t Ravenclaws, and Hermione had felt so proud she’d almost burst. Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink on it, tore it into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the pieces on the table. She could have got it just from crumpling it, but doing all that made it more like garbage, and that helped when someone was first practising the Disposal Charm. Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, “Okay, try it.” “Everto.” “Everto.” “Everto.” “Everto.” Hermione didn’t think she’d quite caught all the problems. “Can you all try it again?” An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan were sort of sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practising something, they would, (2) Hannah and Susan were focused and driven to the point where you had to keep telling them to slow down and relax and think about things instead of trying so hard—it was odd to think that those two would soon be hers—and (3) she liked helping Hufflepuffs, the whole study hall had a very cheerful atmosphere. When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a book while he waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and also a little worried because Harry didn’t seem to really talk to anyone besides her. “Did you know there’s a girl in Hufflepuff who’s a Metamorphmagus?” said Hermione as they headed toward the Great Hall. “She makes her hair really red, like stop-sign red not Weasley red, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she turned into a black-haired boy until she got it under control again.” “Really? Cool,” said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. “Um, Hermione, just to check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign up for Professor Quirrell’s armies, right?” “Yes,” Hermione said. “The armies of the evil Professor Quirrell.” Her voice was a little angry, though Harry didn’t know why, of course. “Hermione,” Harry said, his voice exasperated, “he’s not evil. He’s a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It’s not the same as being evil.” Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his problem. He would have been better off if he’d just divided the universe into Good and Bad. “Professor Quirrell called me up in front of the whole class and told me to shoot someone!” “He was right,” Harry said, his face sober. “I’m sorry, Hermione, but he was. You should have shot me, I wouldn’t have minded. You can’t learn Battle Magic if you can’t practise against real opponents using real spells. And now you’re doing okay in sparring, aren’t you?” Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn’t put it into words, she couldn’t find the thing to say that would convince Harry. Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that girl in front of everyone, and ordered her to open fire without provocation on a classmate. It didn’t matter if Professor Quirrell was right about her needing to learn it. Professor McGonagall wouldn’t ever have done that. Professor Flitwick wouldn’t ever have done that. Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that. Professor Quirrell was evil. But she couldn’t find the words, and she knew that Harry would never believe her. “Hermione, I’ve talked to older students,” Harry said. “Professor Quir- rell could be the only competent Defence Professor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts. Anything else we can learn later. If we want to study De- fence, we have to do it this year. The students who sign up for the extracur- ricular stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way beyond what the Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study—did you know we’re going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In January?” “The Patronus Charm?” Hermione said, her voice going up in surprise. Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a weapon against the Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive emotions. It wasn’t something she’d expect the evil Professor Quirrell to teach—or arrange to be taught, since Hermione couldn’t imagine he could do the spell himself. “Yes,” Harry said. “Students don’t usually learn the Patronus Charm until their fifth year or even later! But Professor Quirrell says the Ministry schedules were made up by talking Flobberworms, and the ability to cast the Patronus Charm depends on emotions more than magical strength. Professor Quirrell says that he thinks most students do way less than they can, and this year he’s going to prove it.” There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry’s voice had when he talked about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her teeth and kept walking. “I already signed up, actually,” Hermione said, her voice a little quiet. “I did it this morning. For everything, just like you said.” In for a penny, in for a pound was the usual expression. Besides, she didn’t want to lose, and if she wanted to win she had to learn. “So you will be in the armies, then?” Harry’s voice was suddenly enthu- siastic. “That’s awesome, Hermione! I’ve already got my list of soldiers, but I’m sure Professor Quirrell will let me add one more, or trade—” “I’m not joining your army.” Hermione’s voice was sharp. She knew it was a reasonable assumption but it still annoyed her. Harry blinked. “Not Draco Malfoy’s, surely. So you want to be in the third army? Even though we don’t know who the general is yet?” Harry sounded surprised and a little wounded, and she couldn’t blame him, though of course she did blame him, since in fact it was all his fault. “But why not mine?” “Think about it,” Hermione snapped, “and maybe you’ll work it out!” And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her. 512 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S 513 CH APTER 2 9 514 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the way be- hind them on their way out of Professor Quirrell’s office. Harry had once spoken dismissively of “people stuff”. And now that was Draco’s only hope. Let him not realize, let him not realize… “We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of our way,” said Draco. “After we crush her, we can have our own contest without any distractions.” “Now that doesn’t really seem fair to her, does it?” said Harry in a mild voice. “What do you care?” said Draco. “She’s your rival, right?” Then, with just the right note of suspicion in his voice, “Don’t tell me you’ve started really liking her, after being her rival all this time…” “Founders forbid,” said Harry. “What can I say, Draco? I merely have a natural sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She has a very firm grasp on good and evil, and she’s probably going to attack evil first. Hav- ing a name like ‘Malfoy’ is just asking for it, you know.” DAMN IT! “Harry,” said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little superior, “don’t you want to fight fairly against me?” “You mean rather than attacking you after you’ve already lost some of your forces beating Granger?” said Harry. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe after I get bored with just winning I’ll try that ‘fair’ thing.” “Maybe she’ll attack you,” Draco said. “You’re her rival.” “But I’m her friendly rival,” Harry said with an evil grin. “I bought her a nice birthday present and everything. You wouldn’t go around sabotaging your friendly rival like that.” “What about sabotaging your friend’s chance at a fair fight?” said Draco angrily. “I thought we were friends!” “Let me rephrase that,” said Harry. “Granger wouldn’t sabotage a friendly rival. But that’s because she has the killing intention of a bowl of wet grapes. You would. You totally would. And guess what, so would I.” DAMN IT! 516 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S 517 CH APTER 2 9 518 E GOCE NTRIC BIA S “Hermione,” Harry said patiently, “we’re supposed to be plotting against each other. You could even betray me and it wouldn’t mean anything outside the battlefield.” Hermione shook her head. “It wouldn’t be nice, Harry.” Harry sighed. “I don’t think you’re getting into the spirit of this at all.” It wouldn’t be nice. She’d actually said that. Hermione didn’t know whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or worried about whether she really did sound like that much of a goody-two-shoes usually. It was probably time to change the subject. “Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?” said Hermi- one. “It’s—” Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized. “Yes, Hermione,” Harry said a little tightly, “what day is it?” 52 0 521 CH APTER 30 52 2 WORKING IN GROUPS I 523 CH APTER 30 524 WORKING IN GROUPS I 525 CH APTER 30 In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the ground as leafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood where the trees were relatively sparser, and looked out on his troops with calm satisfac- tion. Six units of three troops each, the Aerial Unit of four (to which Gre- gory was assigned), and the Command Unit, which was himself and Vin- cent.

Move as a single body. Obey orders and show no fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again, fire again. The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around Draco, watchfully gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they stood, wands gripped low until they needed to strike. They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose training Draco had watched during his father’s inspections. Chaos and Sunshine weren’t going to know what hit them. “Attention,” said General Malfoy. The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his broom- stick riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks already in hand. Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they won their first battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be more willing to salute a Malfoy. But his soldiers were already standing straight enough, especially the Gryffindors, that Draco wondered if he’d even needed to delay. Gregory had quietly listened, and reported back that Draco’s volunteering to stand by Harry Potter in Defence class, that time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how to lose, had marked Draco as an acceptable comman- der. At least if you happened to be assigned to his army. Not all Slythe- rins are alike; there are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins was what the Gryffindors in Draco’s army were quoting to their Housemates. Draco was frankly astounded at how incredibly easy that had been. Draco had protested at first about not being assigned any Slytherins, and Professor Quirrell had told him that if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to gain complete political control of the country, he needed to learn how to govern the other three-quarters of the population. It was things like this which reassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great deal more sympathy for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting on. The actual battle wouldn’t be easy, especially if Granger did attack the Dragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit all his forces against Granger immediately in a pre-emptive strike, but had worried that (1) Harry had been misleading him completely about what Granger was likely to do, and (2) Harry had been misleading him about waiting until after Granger’s attack to join the battle. Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact, which might be enough to win even if they were attacked by both armies at once… It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the pre-battle speech that Draco had composed and memorized. “The battle is about to begin,” Draco said. His voice was calm and pre- cise. “Remember everything that I and Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle showed you. An army wins because it is disciplined and deadly. General Potter and the Chaos Legion will not be disciplined. Granger and the Sunshine Regiment will not be deadly. We are disciplined, we are deadly, we are Dragons. The battle is about to begin, and we are about to win it.” 528 WORKING IN GROUPS I A great booming gong echoed over the forest. And the Sunshine Regiment began to march. 529 CH APTER 30 Draco listened to the flyers’ reports with his face calm, all his shock concealed inside. What could Granger possibly be thinking? Then Draco realized. It’s a feint. One of Sunshine’s two forces would change direction, and both would converge on…who? 530 WORKING IN GROUPS I 531 CH APTER 30 Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest. Something in- side him felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind himself hard that they were only sleeping. There were girls among the fallen, and that made it a lot worse somehow, and he would have to be careful never to mention that in front of Hermione or the Aurors would find his remains stuffed into a small teapot. Half of Sunshine army hadn’t put up much of a fight against all of Chaos. The nine ground soldiers had run in screaming inarticulately with Simple Shields raised, circular screens to protect their faces and chests. But you couldn’t fire and hold the shield at the same time, and Harry’s soldiers had simply aimed for the legs. All but one of the Sunnies had fallen over as soon as the cries of “Somnium!” filled the air. That last one had dropped her shield and managed to take out one of Harry’s soldiers before being hit by the second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex was safe for multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks had been much harder to take down and had accounted for three Chaotics before being felled by massed ground fire. Hermione wasn’t among the fallen. Draco must have got her and that was making Harry feel angry on some completely incomprehensible level, he wasn’t sure if he was feeling protective toward Hermione, or cheated that he hadn’t been the one to do it, or maybe both. “All right,” Harry said, raising his voice. “Let’s everyone be clear on one thing, that wasn’t a real fight. That was General Granger making a mistake in her first battle. Today’s actual fight is with Dragon Army and it’s not going to be anything like this. It’s going to be a lot more fun. Let’s move out.” The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville’s blood until he felt like he could hardly breathe. “We’re closing in,” said General Potter in a voice barely loud enough to carry to the whole army. “Time to spread out.” Neville’s comrades moved away from him. They would still support each other, but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a much easier time hitting you; fire aimed at one of your comrades might miss and get you instead. You would be a lot harder to hit if you spread out and moved as fast as you could. The first thing General Potter had done, during their training session, was get them to fire on each other when both sides were running fast, or both stood still and took time to aim, or one was moving and one was standing still—the reverse charm to the Sleep Hex was simple, though you weren’t allowed to use it during real battles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that happened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that it made more sense for them to focus, not on slowing down to aim carefully, but on moving fast so they wouldn’t get hit. It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching side-by-side with his comrades, but the scary battle-cries they’d learned were already thun- dering in his head and that made up for a lot. This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was absolutely positively not going to squeak. “Shields up,” said General Potter, “power to forward deflectors.” “Contego,” murmured the army, and the circular screens sprang into existence before their heads and chests. A sharp taste filled Neville’s mouth. General Potter wouldn’t have or- dered them to cast shields unless they were almost in range. Neville could see the uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through the dense screens of trees, and the Dragons would be seeing them as well— “Attack!” came a cry from the distance, the voice of Draco Malfoy, and General Potter bellowed, “Charge—” All the adrenaline in Neville’s blood was unleashed, and his legs took over, sending him flying faster than he’d ever run before, straight toward the enemy, knowing without needing to look that all his comrades were doing the same. “Blood for the blood god!” screamed Neville. “Skulls for the skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy’s gate is sideways!” There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself against Neville’s shield. If there’d been other spells fired, they hadn’t hit. Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins’s face, as he stood besides two Gryffindors Neville didn’t recognize, and then— —Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne— —missed— —his racing legs went straight past the enemy grouping and toward another three Dragons, their wands coming up on him, their mouths opening— —not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest floor just as three voices cried “Somnium!” It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he rolled, it wasn’t as bad as falling off his broomstick but he’d still hit the ground pretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden insight, lay still and closed his eyes. “Stop that!” screamed a voice. “Don’t shoot us, we’re Dragons!” With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that he’d man- aged to get between two groups of Dragons just as one group had fired on him. Harry had talked about this as a tactic for making the enemy afraid to fire, but apparently it worked a bit better than that. And not only that, the Dragons believed they’d got him, since they’d seen Neville fall just as they fired. Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes a crack. The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly as cries of “Somnium!” and “Skulls for the skull throne!” filled the air around them. All three had Simple Shields up now. Neville’s wand was still in his hand, and it didn’t take much effort to point it at one boy’s boots and whisper “Somnium.” Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard the boy fall to the ground. “Where’d it come from?” screamed Justin Finch-Fletchley’s voice, and Neville heard rustles on the leafy forest floor, as of two Dragons spinning around looking for an enemy. “Reform ranks!” bellowed Malfoy’s voice. “To me, everyone, don’t let them scatter you!” Neville’s ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his prone body as they ran off. Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit painfully, and then pointed his wand and said the new charm that General Potter had taught them all. They couldn’t do real illusion spells to confuse the enemy, but even at their age they could— “Ventriliquo,” whispered Neville, pointing the wand to one side of Justin and the other boy, and then yelled, “For Cthulhu and glory!” Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields to- ward where Neville had moved his battle-cry, and that was when multiple cries of “Somnium!” filled the air and the other boy dropped before Neville was finished aiming. “The last one’s mine!” yelled Neville, and then he started sprinting straight toward Justin, who’d been mean to him until the older Huf- flepuffs straightened him out. Neville was surrounded by his comrades and that meant— “Special attack, Chaotic Leap!” howled Neville as he ran, and felt his body lighten, then lighten twice again, as his comrades got their wands turned toward him and quietly cast the Hover Charm, and Neville raised his left hand and snapped his fingers and then used his legs to push off the ground as hard as he could and soared through the air. Sheer shock painted Justin’s face as Neville went over the other boy’s shield and pointed his wand down at the form passing beneath him and cried “Somnium!” Because he’d felt like it, that was why. Neville didn’t quite get his feet turned around properly and rather ploughed into the ground as he landed, but two out of three of the other Chaos Legionnaires had managed to hold their wands on him throughout and he didn’t hit very hard. And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be moving, people were yelling “Somnium!” all over the place— “I am Neville, last scion of Longbottom!” screamed Neville to the sky above, holding his wand pointed straight up as though to challenge the blazing blue heaven itself, knowing that nothing after this day would ever be the same again. “Neville of Chaos! Face me if you da—” (When Neville woke up afterwards, he was told that Dragon Army had taken this as their cue to counter-attack.) 537 CH APTER 30 When Harry’s eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a com- fortable position with his hands folded over his chest, holding his wand like a fallen hero. Slowly, Harry sat up. His magic was aching, a strange sensation but not an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn and lethargy that fol- lowed hard physical exercise. “The general’s awake!” cried a voice, and Harry blinked and focused in that direction. Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic hemi- sphere, and Harry realized that the battle wasn’t over. Right…he hadn’t been hit by a Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself, so when he woke up, he was still in the game. Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from someone-or-other about not exhausting his magic to the point of unconsciousness over a children’s game. But he hadn’t hurt Mr Goyle when he’d lost his temper, and that was the important thing. Then Harry’s mind clicked on another implication, and he looked down at the steel ring on his left hand’s pinky finger, and almost swore out loud when he saw that the tiny diamond was missing and there was a marshmallow lying on the ground near where he’d fallen. He’d sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and would now need to start over. Could’ve been worse. He could’ve done this fourteen days later, after Professor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure his father’s rock. That was one very good lesson to learn the easy way. Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before completely exhausting magic. Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using up your magic didn’t exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees cer- tainly did. He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained Draco Malfoy, who was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield, and smiling coldly at Harry. “Where’s the fifth soldier?” said Harry. “Um…” said a boy whose name Harry couldn’t remember at the mo- ment. “I fired a Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and hit Lavender, I mean the angle shouldn’t have been right but it did…” Draco was smirking inside the shield. “So let me guess,” Harry said, looking Draco directly in the eyes, “those neat little trios are the formation used by professional magical militaries? Made up of trained soldiers who can easily hit moving targets if their own hands are steady, and who can combine their defensive powers so long as they stay together? Unlike your soldiers?” The smirk had vanished from Draco’s face, which was now hard and grim. “You know,” Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others would understand the real message passing between them, “it just goes to show that you should always question everything you see your role models do- ing, and ask why it’s being done, and whether it makes sense in context for you to do it too. Don’t forget to apply that advice to real life, by the way. And thanks for the slow-moving clustered targets.” Because Draco had already had that lecture, and, Harry suspected, discounted it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to shift his loyalties further away from pureblood tradition. Which of course Harry was. But this example would make an excellent excuse, next Saturday, to claim that questioning authority was a merely practical technique for real life. And Harry would also mention the experiments he’d run, first with individu- als and then with groups, to check that his ideas about the importance of speed had actually been correct, by way of hammering home the point of Draco needing to keep an eye out at all times for chances to apply the methods in everyday practice. “You haven’t won yet, General Potter!” snarled Draco. “Maybe we’ll run out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a draw.” A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor Quir- rell, in his personal judgement, decided one army had won by practical real-world standards. There was no formal victory condition, Professor Quirrell had explained, because then Harry would figure out how to game the rules. Harry had to admit this was a fair cop. And Harry couldn’t blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an end, be- cause it was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army could take out all five survivors of the Chaos Legion. “All right,” Harry said. “Does anyone know anything about General Malfoy’s shield spell?” It developed that Draco’s shield was a version of the standard Protego which had several disadvantages, the most important of which was that the shield couldn’t move with the caster. The upside—or from Harry’s perspective, downside—was that it was easier to learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for long times. They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order to bring it down. And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of re- flection at which the spells would bounce off. The thought occurred to Harry that they could use Wingardium Leviosa to pile up heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn’t sustain it against the pressure…but then the rocks might fall in afterwards and hit Draco, and injuring the enemy general for real was not among today’s goals. “So,” said Harry. “Are there such things as specialized shield-piercing spells?” There were. Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them. No-one did. Draco was smirking again, inside his shield. Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that wouldn’t bounce. Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields instead of bouncing off them. …No-one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related spell. Draco sniggered. Harry sighed. He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground. And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that he would just go ahead and take down the shield himself, using some method that would remain mysterious; and everyone else was to fire on Draco as soon as his shield went down. The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous. Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled. A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry’s pouch. Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the blanket over his head so no-one could see what he did—except Draco, of course. From Harry’s pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper cables. …it wasn’t like he’d been about to leave the Muggle world to start a new era of magical research, and not take along any way of generating electricity. Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingers snapping, followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket. The shield started glowing more brightly, and Harry’s voice said, “Don’t be distracted please, eyes on General Malfoy.” The strain was showing on Draco’s face, along with the fury and an- noyance and frustration. Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, Tell you later. And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the forest and smashed into Draco’s shield, which shrieked like pieces of sharp glass be- ing rubbed together, and Draco staggered. In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the battery and fed them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself into the pouch, and then he tore off the blanket and grabbed his wand and stood up. All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around frantically. “Contego,” Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit, but Harry didn’t even know which direction the shield ought to be pointing in. “Did anyone see where that came from?” Shaken heads. “And General Malfoy, would you mind telling me if you got General Granger?” “Why yes,” Draco said acidly, “I mind.” Oh, hell. Harry’s mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco worn out now to some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the woods who- knew-where, Harry and four other Chaotics left… “You know, General Granger,” Harry said out loud, “you really should’ve waited to attack until after I’d fought General Malfoy. You might’ve been able to get all the survivors.” From somewhere came a girl’s high-pitched laughter. Harry froze. That wasn’t Hermione. And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to rise, coming from all around them. “Don’t be frightened, don’t be sad, We’ll only hurt you if you’re bad…” “Granger cheated!” burst out Draco inside the shield. “She woke up her soldiers! Why doesn’t Professor Quirrell—” “Let me guess,” Harry said, the sickness already churning in his stom- ach. He really hated losing. “It was a very easy battle, right? They dropped like flies?” “Yes,” Draco said. “We got them all on the first shot—” The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos Le- gionnaires. “No,” Harry said, “we didn’t.” Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees. “Allies?” Harry said. “Allies,” Draco said. “Good,” said General Granger’s voice, and a spiral of green energy blazed out of the woods and shattered Draco’s shield to splinters. 543 545 CH APTER 31 In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into space, as though the wall in front of his desk was the most fascinating surface in the world. How? How? In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning plots went, but Granger wasn’t supposed to be cunning! She’d been too much of a Huf- flepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had Professor Quirrell been advising her despite his promise, or… And then Draco finally did what he should have done much earlier. What he should have done after the first time he met with Granger. What Harry Potter had told him to do, trained him to do, and yet Harry had also warned Draco that it would take time to make his brain realize that the methods applied to real life, and Draco hadn’t understood that until today. He could have avoided every single one of his mistakes if he’d just applied the things Harry had already told him— Draco said out loud, “I notice that I am confused.” Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality… Draco was confused. Therefore, something he believed was fiction. Granger should not have been able to do all that. Therefore, she probably hadn’t. I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the two of you don’t know about. With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the way, hunting through the mess on his desk, until he found it. And there it was. Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of the three armies. Curse Professor Quirrell! Draco had read it and he still hadn’t seen it— 547 CH APTER 31 548 549 CH APTER 32 The bright hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley had increased by a hun- dredfold and redoubled as Christmas approached, with all the shops enshrouded in brilliant sorceries that flashed and sparkled as though the season’s spirit was about to blaze out of control and turn the whole area into a cheerful holiday crater. The streets were so crowded with witches and wizards in festive and loud clothing that your eyes were assaulted almost as severely as your ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering va- riety of the shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an international attraction. There were witches wrapped in giant swathes of cloth like towelled mummies, and wizards in formal top hats and bath-robes, and young children barely past toddling age who were decorated with lights that blazed almost as bright as the shops themselves, as their parents took them hand in hand through that magic wonderland and let them shriek to their heart’s content. It was the season to be merry. And in the midst of all that light and cheer, a note of blackest night; a cold, dark atmosphere that cleared a few precious paces of distance even in the midst of all that crush. “No,” said Professor Quirrell, with a look of grim revulsion, like he’d just bitten into food that not only tasted horrible but was morally repug- nant to boot. It was the sort of grim face an ordinary person might make after biting into a meat pie, and discovering that it was rotten and had been made from kittens. “Oh, come on,” Harry said. “You must have some ideas.” “Mr Potter,” Professor Quirrell said, his lips set in a thin line, “I agreed to act as your adult guardian on this expedition. I did not agree to advise you on your choice of presents. I don’t do Christmas, Mr Potter.” “How about Newtonmas?” Harry said brightly. “Isaac Newton actually was born on December 25th, unlike some other historical figures I could name.” This failed to impress Professor Quirrell. “Look,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but I’ve got to do something special for Fred and George and I’ve got no idea of my options.” Professor Quirrell made a thoughtful humming sound. “You could ask which family members they most dislike, and then hire an assas- sin. I know someone from a certain government-in-exile who is quite competent, and he would give you a discount on multiple Weasleys.” “This Christmas,” Harry said, dropping his voice into a lower register, “give your friends the gift…of death.” That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went all the way to his eyes. “Well,” said Harry, “at least you didn’t suggest getting them a pet rat—” Harry’s mouth snapped shut, and he was regretting the words almost as soon as they were out of his mouth. “Pardon me?” said Professor Quirrell. “Nothing,” Harry said at once, “long dumb story.” And telling it seemed wrong somehow, maybe because Harry was afraid Professor Quirrell would have laughed even if Bill Weasley hadn’t been cured and everything put back to right… And where had Professor Quirrell been that he’d never heard the story? Harry had got the impression that everyone in magical Britain knew. “Look,” said Harry, “I’m trying to solidify their loyalty to me, you know? Make the Weasley twins my minions? Like the old saying goes: a friend isn’t someone you use once and then throw away, a friend is someone you use over and over again. Fred and George are two of the most use- ful friends I have in Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell, and I plan to use them over and over again. So if you’d help me be Slytherin here, and suggest something they might be very grateful for…” Harry’s voice trailed off invit- ingly. You just had to pitch these things the right way. They walked on for a good way before Professor Quirrell spoke again, his voice practically dripping with distaste. “The Weasley twins are using second-hand wands, Mr Potter. They would be reminded of your generos- ity with every Charm they cast.” Harry clapped his hands together in involuntary excitement. Just put the money on account at Ollivander’s, and tell Mr Ollivander to never re- fund it—no, better yet, to send it to Lucius Malfoy if the Weasley twins didn’t show up before the start of their next school year. “That’s brilliant, Professor!” Professor Quirrell did not look like he appreciated the compliment. “I suppose I can tolerate Christmas in that spirit, Mr Potter, though only barely.” Then he smiled slightly. “Of course that will cost you fourteen Galleons, and you only have five.” “Five Galleons,” Harry said, with a sniff of outrage. “Just who does the Headmaster think he’s dealing with, anyway?” “I think,” said Professor Quirrell, “that it simply did not occur to him to fear the consequences if you turned your ingenuity to the task of obtain- ing funds. Though you were wise to lose, rather than making it an explicit threat. Out of curiosity, Mr Potter, what would you have done if I hadn’t turned away in boredom while you, in a fit of childish pique, counted out five Galleons worth of Knuts?” “Well, the easiest way would’ve been to borrow money from Draco Mal- foy,” said Harry. Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. “Seriously, Mr Potter.” Duly noted. “Probably I’d have done a few celebrity appearances. I wouldn’t resort to anything economically disruptive just for spending money.” Harry had checked, and he would be allowed to keep the Time- Turner while he went home for the holidays, so that his sleep cycle didn’t start to rotate. But then it was also possible that someone kept an eye out for magical day traders. The gold and silver trick would’ve taken work on the Muggle end, and seed funding, and the goblins might’ve become suspicious after the first cycle. And starting a real bank would be a lot of work…Harry hadn’t quite worked out any money-making methods that were fast and certain and safe, so he’d been very glad when Professor Quirrell had turned out to be so easily fooled. “I do hope those five Galleons will be enough to last, since you counted them so carefully,” said Professor Quirrell. “I doubt the Headmaster shall be so eager to entrust me with your vault key a second time, once he dis- covers I’ve been tricked.” “I’m sure you did your best,” Harry said with deep gratitude. “Do you need any assistance finding a safe place to store all those Knuts, Mr Potter?” “Well, sort of,” said Harry. “Do you know of any good investment op- portunities, Professor Quirrell?” And the two of them walked on, in their tiny sphere of silence and iso- lation, through the brilliant and bustling crowds; and if you looked care- fully, you would see that where they went, leafy boughs faded, and flowers withered, and children’s toys that played cheerful bells changed to lower and more ominous notes. Harry did notice, but he didn’t say anything, just smiled a little to him- self. Everyone had their own way of celebrating the holidays, and the Grinch was as much a part of Christmas as Santa. CHAPTER THIRT Y-THREE COORDINATION PROBLEMS, PART I The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiralled out of control. “Albus,” Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of her voice as the two of them entered the Great Hall, “something has to be done.” The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright and cheerful. The Great Hall had already been decorated in green and red, af- ter a Slytherin and a Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had become a symbol of friendship transcending Houses and allegiances, a tradition almost as ancient as Hogwarts itself and which had even spread to Muggle coun- tries. Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over their shoulders, or sending vicious glares at other tables, or at some tables ar- guing heatedly. You could have described the atmosphere as tense, per- haps, but the phrase coming to Minerva’s mind was fifth degree of caution. Take a school, into four Houses divided… Now into each year, add three armies at war. And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spread beyond the first-years; they had become the armies for those who had no armies. Students were wearing armbands with insignia of fire or smile or upraised hand, and hexing each other in the corridors. All three first-year generals had told them to stop—even Draco Malfoy had heard her out and then nodded grimly—but their supposed followers hadn’t listened. Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. “In every city,” the old wizard quoted softly, “the population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions…And they fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves…So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for my part, am unable to call this anything except a disease of the soul…” “I’m sorry,” said Minerva, “I don’t—” “Procopius,” said Dumbledore. “They took their chariot-racing very se- riously, in the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that something must be done.” “Soon,” Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. “Albus, I think it must be done before Saturday.” On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the holiday with their families; Saturday, then, was the final battle of the three first- year armies that would determine the awarding of Professor Quirrell’s thrice-cursed Christmas wish. Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. “You fear that the explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt.” Minerva nodded. “And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed.” Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since become wise in the ways that Defence Professors were fired. “Albus,” Minerva said, “we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we cannot! If he but stays through Jan- uary our fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months, a whole generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of the Dark Lord’s curse—you must stop the battle, Albus! Ban the armies now!” “I am not sure the Defence Professor would take that kindly,” said Dumbledore, glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell was drooling into his soup. “He did seem most attached to his armies, though when I agreed I thought there would be four in each year.” The old wizard sighed. “A clever man, probably with the best of intentions; but perhaps not clever enough, I fear. And to ban the armies might also trigger the explosion.” “But then Albus, what will you do?” The old wizard favoured her with a benign smile. “Why, I shall plot, of course. It’s the new fashion in Hogwarts.” And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say any- thing more. 557 CH APTER 33 558 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiralled out of control. Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling ut- terly and completely helpless. There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names, and some of the lines were in different colours and… “Tell me,” said General Granger, “is there anyone in my army who isn’t a spy?” The two of them weren’t in the office but in another, deserted class- room, and they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said, it was now nearly certain that at least one of the captains was a traitor. Probably Cap- tain Goldstein, but Zabini didn’t know for sure. Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin’s face. Blaise Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but he didn’t seem to actively dislike her; nothing like the derision he held for Draco Mal- foy, or the resentment he had developed for Harry Potter. She had wor- ried at first about Zabini betraying her, but the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two generals were no better than him; and Hermi- one thought that while Zabini would probably be happy to sell her out to anyone else, he’d never let Malfoy or Harry win. “Most of your soldiers are still loyal to you, I’m pretty sure,” said Zabini. “It’s just that no-one wants to be left out of the fun.” The scornful look on the Slytherin’s face made it clear what he thought of people who didn’t take plotting seriously. “So they think they can be double agents and se- cretly work for our side while pretending to betray us.” “And that would also go for anyone in the other armies who says they want to be our spy,” Hermione said carefully. The young Slytherin shrugged. “I think I did a good job of telling which ones really want to sell out Malfoy, I’m not sure anyone really wants to sell out Potter to you. But Nott is a sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy and since I had Entwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and Entwhistle really reports to us, that’s almost as good—” Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. “We’re going to lose, aren’t we?” “Look,” Zabini said patiently, “You’re in the lead right now on Quirrell points. We just have to not lose this last battle completely and you’ll have enough Quirrell points to win the Christmas wish.” Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would operate on a formal scoring system, which he’d been asked to do to avoid recrim- inations afterwards. Each time you shot someone, the general of your army got two Quirrell points. A gong would ring through the battle area (they didn’t know yet where they would be fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where Sunshine did well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the points. And if anyone was faking being hit, the gong would ring out anyway, and then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed time, to hail the retraction. And if you called the name of an army, cried “For Sunshine!” or “For Chaos!” or “For Dragon!”, it switched your allegiance to that army… Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in that set of rules. But Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if you’d been originally assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you in the name of Sunshine— or rather, they could, but then Sunshine lost a single Quirrell point, sym- bolized by a triple gong. That prevented you from shooting your own sol- diers for points, and discouraged suicide before the enemy got you, but you could still shoot spies if you had to. Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell points, and Malfoy had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two hundred and twenty-one; and there were twenty-four soldiers in each army. “So we fight carefully,” Hermione said, “and just try not to lose too badly.” “No,” said Zabini. The young Slytherin’s face was now serious. “The problem is, Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to win is to combine and crush us, then fight it out on their own. So here’s what I think we should do—” Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini’s plan hadn’t been the obvious one, it had been strange and complicated and lay- ered and the sort of thing she would’ve expected Harry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong just for her to be able to understand a plan like that. Young girls shouldn’t be able to understand plans like that. The Hat would’ve Sorted her into Slytherin, if it’d seen that she could understand plans like that… 561 CH APTER 33 562 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of blood dancing across the floor from behind Harry Potter’s grown-up–sized cushioned chair, which he had covered in gold and silver glitter and insisted on referring to as his throne. (Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he’d done the right thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he could take over the world. Draco couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to live under his rule.) “Good evening, Dragon General,” said Harry Potter in a chill whisper. “You have arrived just as I expected.” This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had agreed on the meeting time in advance. And it also wasn’t evening, but by now Draco knew better than to say anything. “General Potter,” Draco said with as much dignity as he could manage, “you know that our two armies have to work together for either of us to win Professor Quirrell’s wish, right?” “Yesss,” hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a Parselmouth. “We must cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then fight it out between us. But if one of us betrays the other earlier on, that one could gain an advantage in the later fight. And the Sunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick each of us into thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know that, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is Granger’s trickery. And Granger knows that, as well.” Draco nodded. That much was obvious. “And…both of us only want to win, and there’s no-one else who’ll punish either of us if we defect…” “Precisely,” said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious. “We are faced with a true Prisoner’s Dilemma.” The Prisoner’s Dilemma, according to Harry’s teachings, ran thus. Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was evidence against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to defect, betray the other, testify against them in court; and this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add two years to the other’s. Or a pris- oner could cooperate, staying silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying against the other, they would serve three years apiece; if both cooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but if one defected and the other cooperated, the defector would serve a single year, and the cooperator would serve four. And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing the other one’s choice, and neither would be given a chance to change their decision afterwards. Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors. Harry had nodded and said that was one way to resolve the Prisoner’s Dilemma—and in fact both Death Eaters would want there to be a Dark Lord for exactly that reason. (Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this for a while before they continued. It had explained a lot about why Father and his friends had agreed to serve under a Dark Lord who often wasn’t nice to them…) In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why people had governments—you might be better off if you stole from someone else, just like each prisoner would be individually better off if they defected in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. But if everyone thought like that, the country would fall into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by governments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled by the Dark Lord. (Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for granted that ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they wanted to rule, and people let themselves be ruled because they were scared little Hufflepuffs. And this, on reflection, still seemed true; but Harry’s perspective was fascinating even if it was wrong.) But, Harry had continued afterwards, the fear of a third party pun- ishing you was not the only possible reason to cooperate in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magi- cally produced identical copy of yourself. Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither Draco would want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to mention that no Malfoy would let himself become known as a traitor. Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet another solution to the Prisoner’s Dilemma—people might cooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had senses of honour, or because they wanted to preserve their reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to construct a true Prisoner’s Dilemma—in real life, people usu- ally cared about the other person, or their honour or their reputation or a Dark Lord’s punishment or something besides the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been of someone completely selfish— (Pansy Parkinson had been the example they’d used) —so each Pansy only cared what happened to her and not to the other Pansy. Given that this was all Pansy cared about…and that there was no Dark Lord…and Pansy wasn’t worried about her reputation…and Pansy either had no sense of honour or didn’t consider herself obliged to the other pris- oner…then would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect? Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do was for Pansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone named Dou- glas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because, Harry had said, if Pansy defected—not at random, but for what seemed to her like rational reasons—then the other Pansy would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn’t decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in which both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies defected, and she was better off if both copies cooper- ated. And if Harry had thought ‘rational’ people did defect in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, then he wouldn’t have done anything to spread that kind of ‘ra- tionality’, because a country or a conspiracy full of ‘rational’ people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your enemies about ‘rationality’. Which had all sounded reasonable at the time, but now the thought was occurring to Draco that… “You said,” Draco said, “that the rational solution to the Prisoner’s Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course you would want me to believe that, wouldn’t you?” And if Draco was fooled into cooperating, Harry would just say, Ha ha, betrayed you again! and laugh at him about it afterwards. “I wouldn’t fake your lessons,” Harry said seriously. “But I have to re- mind you, Draco, that I didn’t say you should just automatically cooperate. Not on a true Prisoner’s Dilemma like this one. What I said was that when you choose, you shouldn’t think like you’re choosing for just yourself, or like you’re choosing for everyone. You should think like you’re choosing for all the people who are similar enough to you that they’ll probably do the same thing you do for the same reasons. And also choosing the pre- dictions made by anyone who knows you well enough to predict you ac- curately, so that you never have to regret being rational because of the correct predictions that other people make about you—remind me to ex- plain about Newcomb’s Problem at some point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this: are we similar enough that we’ll probably do the same thing whatever it is, making our decisions in mostly the same way? Or do we know each other well enough to predict each other, so that I can predict whether you’ll cooperate or defect, and you can predict that I’ve decided to do the same thing I predict you’ll do, because I know that you can predict me deciding that?” …and Draco could not help but think that since he had to strain just to understand half of that, the answer was obviously ‘No’. “Yes,” said Draco. There was a pause. “I see,” said Harry, sounding disappointed. “Oh, well. I guess we’ll have to think of some other way, then.” Draco hadn’t thought that was going to work. Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both agreed much earlier that what they did on the battlefield would not count as bro- ken promises in real life—though Draco was a little angry about what Harry had done in Professor Quirrell’s office, and said so. But if the two of them couldn’t rely on honour or friendship, that did leave the question of how to get their armies to work together on beating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might try to break them up. Profes- sor Quirrell’s rules didn’t make it tempting to let Sunshine kill the other army’s soldiers—that just increased the bar you had to pass yourself— but it did tempt each side to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or to shoot some of the other side’s soldiers during the confusion of battle… 567 CH APTER 33 Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking in hushed voices, as though the first to shout might set off the explosion. 568 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I 569 CH APTER 33 Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in his lungs. They’d fought in the forest, and he hadn’t had a chance to say it. They’d fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn’t had a chance to say it. They’d fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier, and it still hadn’t made sense to say it. Harry had thought he wouldn’t ever get to say those words, not while he was still young enough for them to be real… The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as their general swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant light of the sur- face, and his head pointed down toward the murky depths. “Why are you upside-down?” the young commander shouted at his army, and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned the privileged ori- entation of gravity. 570 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I 571 CH APTER 33 Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along. Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions. Div- ing, always diving in whatever direction you happened to be moving. You wanted to show the enemy the smallest profile, present them with your head or your feet. So you were always diving, downward and head-first, and the enemy was always down. Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville’s head was con- stantly rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every side. Not just watching for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any sign that a Chaos Legionnaire had drawn their wand and was about to betray them. Usually traitors waited until the confusion of battle to make their move, but that early gong had put them all on guard. …the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In November he’d been a soldier in a united army, all of them pulling together and helping each other, and now they were all watching each other constantly for the first signs of betrayal. It might have been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn’t nearly as much fun for Neville. The direction formerly known as ‘up’ was getting steadily brighter, as they came closer to the surface and Sunshine. “Wands out,” said General Chaos. Neville’s squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead to- ward the enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If there were Sunny traitors, the time was approaching for them to strike. The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same thing. “Now!” shouted the distant voice of the Dragon General. “Now!” shouted General Chaos. “For Sunshine!” shouted all the soldiers in both armies, and charged downward. 573 CH APTER 33 For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged her own seventeen, Hermione’s mind went blank. Why… Then it all snapped into place. Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by someone crying the name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell point. When two Sunshine Soldiers were shot by either army, both enemy armies would be two points closer to overtaking her, it was the same gain only shared. And if anyone shot another soldier not in the name of Sunshine, that gong wouldn’t get lost in the confusion… Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn’t gone with the obvious plan of starting trouble between the other two armies while they attacked Sunshine. It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances closing down, of hope being taken away. Most of Hermione’s soldiers were still looking confused, but some had expressions of dawning horror as they got it. “It’s all right,” Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look at the Sunshine Captain. “Our job is the same, to take as many of them with us as we can. And remember, Zabini took away all the spies! We don’t have to stay on the lookout like they do!” The girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering smiles from many of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. “It can be like it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight our best, and trust each other—” Daphne shot her. 574 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220 It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could hardly stand to look at the expression of peace that had come over her sleeping face, arms now drifting aimlessly as the curves of sunlight moved over her camouflage uniform and the cloud of her chestnut hair. And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot her…not only would Draco have known what it meant, Hermione would have been offended. She’s not dead, Harry said to his brain as his kicking feet pushed him away, she’s just resting. Idiot. Are you sure? said his brain. What if she’s an ex-Hermione? Could we go back and check? Harry glanced back briefly. See, she’s fine, there are bubbles coming out of her mouth. Could’ve been her last breath escaping. Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective, anyway? Er, first real friend we’ve ever had in our whole life? Hey, remember what hap- pened to our pet rock? Would you shut up about that worthless lump of rubble, it wasn’t even alive let alone sentient, that is like the most pathetic childhood trauma ever— The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish once more. General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three Chaotics and two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons had been shot as traitors. So she’d lost net seven points, Harry had lost one, Draco had lost two; that put Sunshine twenty points up on Dragon, and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos could still win easily if they ex- terminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The wild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine Soldiers… …if you could call them that. The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in each army awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and attack… “Everyone who got them,” Harry said loudly, “remember Special Or- ders One through Three. And don’t forget it’s Merlin Says on Three. Do not acknowledge.” The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the other third just looked puzzled. Special Order One: Don’t bother trying to call out any codewords in this battle, don’t expend effort on any plot not specially approved by the commander; just swim, shield, and fire. Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying to get them to stop plotting on their own all through December. Harry had egged his soldiers on and supported their plotting through the last two battles…while also telling them that at some future point he might ask them to put a plot or two on hold, to which they’d all readily agreed. So now, in this critical battle, they were happy to obey. Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order successfully, Harry was certain. It was the difference between your soldiers seeing you as an ally in their plotting, and seeing you as a spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn’t want them to have any fun. Imposition of order equalled esca- lation of chaos, and it also worked in reverse… “There they are!” shouted someone, and pointed. From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones who’d forsaken the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine Soldiers, glowing with the bright aura of cowards, now fading as they returned to battle. The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily. “Hold your fire!” shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from General Malfoy. There was a moment of held breath. Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon Army. There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army. There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion. Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn’t have. Harry wasn’t smiling. Oh, this is so completely not going to work… But Harry hadn’t been able to think of anything better. “Special Orders Two and Three still apply!” shouted Harry. “Fight!” “For the Chaos Legion!” roared twenty Chaotic Legionnaires. “For Dragon Army!” roared twenty Dragon Warriors and seven Sun- shine Soldiers. And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors got ready to strike. 578 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I 579 CH APTER 33 580 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252 Longbottom’s body drifted chaotically through the water, arms and legs disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they’d all shot him again just to be sure. Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere, look- ing at them all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon slowly dimin- ished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom had managed to shoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was thinking), if the two Chaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer, they might have won… After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the ensuing battle and execution of spies in Sunshine’s name had left Sunshine exactly one point ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once Harry had started doing it, Draco had been left with no choice but to follow suit. But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the sur- vivors of Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor: Draco, and Padma, and Zabini. And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini’s wand after Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco. The boy had given him an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him for this, and handed it over. That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos. “I don’t suppose you’d like to surrender?” said Draco, smiling as evilly as any smile he’d ever directed at Harry Potter. “Sleep before surrender!” shouted General Chaos. “Just so you know,” said Draco, “Zabini doesn’t actually have an older sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor bullies. But Zabini does have a mother who doesn’t approve of Muggle-borns like Granger, and I wrote her a few notes, and offered Zabini a few favours—nothing involv- ing my father, just things I can do in school. And by the way, Zabini’s mother doesn’t approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you still thought Zabini was really on your side.” Harry’s face grew even grimmer. Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically, building up strength for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger’s Prismatic Sphere was al- most as strong as Draco’s now, and Harry’s wasn’t much weaker, where did those two find time? “Lagann!” spoke Draco, putting everything he had into it, and the green spiral blazed out and Harry’s shield shattered, and at almost the same moment— “Somnium!” said Padma. 582 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254 And Harry Potter’s body floated away, his expression of shock and hor- ror quickly relaxing into sleep. “On second thought,” Parvati said cheerfully, “make that Gryffindors for Sunshine.” She started to laugh, more exhilarated than she’d ever been in her life, she’d finally got to assassinate and replace her twin sister and she’d wanted to do that since forever, and this had been perfect, it had all been perfect— —and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as Zabini’s wand turned to point at her. “Wait!” said Zabini. “Do not shoot, do not resist. That’s an order.” “What?” said Parvati. “Sorry,” said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic, “but I can’t be totally sure you’re for Sunshine. So I order you to let me shoot you.” “Hold on!” said Parvati. “We’re only ahead of Chaos by one point! If you shoot me now—” “I’ll shoot you in the name of Dragon, obviously,” said Zabini, now sounding a little superior. “Just because we tricked them into doing it, doesn’t mean it won’t work for us.” Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. “General Malfoy said your mother doesn’t like Hermione.” “I suppose,” said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. “But some of us are more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a parent.” “And Harry Potter said you have a cousin—” “Nope,” said Zabini. Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn’t really good at plotting; Zabini’d said the plan was to secretly keep the scores of Chaos and Dragon as even as possible so they’d use Sunshine’s name to execute their traitors instead of losing even a single point, and that had worked… but…she had the feeling she was missing something, she wasn’t a Slythe- rin… “Why don’t I shoot you in the name of Dragon?” said Parvati. “Because I outrank you,” said Zabini. Parvati had a bad feeling about this. She stared at him for a long moment. And then— “Somni—” she started to say, and then realized she hadn’t said for Dragon, and frantically cut herself off— 584 COORDINATION PROBLEMS I 585 Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring at each other in mingled fury and frustration. It didn’t help that they were still damp from being fished out of the lake, and that the Warming Charms didn’t seem quite enough to make up for the crisp December air, or maybe it was just their mood. “That’s it,” said Granger. “I’ve had it! No more traitors!” “I completely agree with you, Miss Granger,” Draco said icily. “Enough is enough.” “And what do you two intend to do about it?” snapped Harry Potter. “Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn’t ban spies!” “We’ll ban them for him,” said Draco grimly. He hadn’t even under- stood what he meant by the words as he said them, but the very act of speaking seemed to crystallize a plan— 588 COORDINATION PROBLEMS II 589 CH APTER 34 59 0 COORDINATION PROBLEMS II “Make no mistake,” said Professor Quirrell. “The Dark Lord was win- ning. There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared face him, the vigi- lantes who opposed him were being hunted down. One Dark Lord and perhaps fifty Death Eaters were winning against a country of thousands. That is beyond ridiculous! There are no grades low enough for me to mark that incompetence!” There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and on the faces of the audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went on. “Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I allowed traitors, and gave the generals no means to restrain them. You saw the result. Clever plots and clever betrayals, until the last soldier left on the battlefield shot himself! You cannot possibly doubt that all three of those armies could have been defeated by any outside foe that was unified within itself.” Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now filled with a grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers open and spread. “Division is weakness,” said the Defence Professor. His hand closed into a tight fist. “Unity is strength. The Dark Lord understood that well, whatever his other follies; and he used that understanding to create the one simple invention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord in history. Your parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters who were perfectly unified, knowing that any breach of their loyalty would be punished by death, that any slack or incompetence would be punished by pain. None could escape the Dark Lord’s grasp once they took his Mark. And the Death Eaters agreed to take that terrible Mark because they knew that once they took it, they would be united, facing a divided land. One Dark Lord and fifty Death Eaters would have defeated an entire country, by the power of the Dark Mark.” Professor Quirrell’s voice was bleak and hard. “Your parents could have fought back in kind. They did not. There was a man named Yermy Wibble who called upon the nation to institute a draft, though he did not quite have vision enough to propose a Mark of Britain. Yermy Wib- ble knew what would happen to him; he hoped his death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his family for good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing but fear, and no-one dared to speak again. And your parents would have faced the consequences of their despicable cow- ardice, if not for being saved by a one-year-old boy.” Professor Quirrell’s face showed full contempt. “A dramatist would have called that a deus ex machina, for they did nothing to earn their salvation. He-Who-Must-Not- Be-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no doubt of it, your parents deserved to lose.” The voice of the Defence Professor rang forth like iron. “And know this: your parents have learned nothing! The nation is still fragmented and weak! How few decades passed between Grindelwald and You-Know- Who? Do you think you will not see the next threat in your own lifetimes? Will you repeat then the follies of your parents, when you have seen the results so clearly laid out before you this day? For I can tell you what your parents will do, when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson they have learned! They have learned to hide like cowards and do nothing while they wait for Harry Potter to save them!” There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore; and other students gazed up at their Defence Professor with bewilder- ment and anger and awe. Professor Quirrell’s eyes were as cold now as his voice. “Mark this, and mark it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule over this country, to hold it in his cruel grasp forever. But at least he wished to rule over a living country, and not a heap of ash! There have been Dark Lords who were mad, who wished only to make the world a vast funeral pyre! There have been wars in which one whole country marched against another! Your parents nearly lost against half a hundred, who thought to take this country alive! How quickly would they have been crushed by a foe more numerous than they, a foe that cared for nothing but their destruction? This I foretell: when the next threat rises, Lucius Malfoy will claim that you must follow him or perish, that your only hope is to trust in his cruelty and strength. And though Lucius Malfoy himself will believe it, this will be a lie. For when the Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy did not unite the Death Eaters, they were shattered in an instant, they fled like whipped dogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy is not strong enough to be a true Lord, Dark or otherwise.” Draco Malfoy’s fists were clenched white, there were tears in his eyes, and fury, and unbearable shame. “No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I do not think it will be Lucius Malfoy who saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own behalf, time will make clear soon enough that this is not so. I make you no recom- mendation, my students. But I say that if a whole country were to find a leader as strong as the Dark Lord, but honourable and pure, and take his Mark; then they could crush any Dark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of our divided magical world could not threaten them. And if some still greater enemy rose against us in a war of extermination, then only a united magical world could survive.” There were gasps, mostly from Muggle-borns; the students in green- trimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter whose fists were clenched tight and trembling; and Hermione Granger beside him was angry and dismayed. The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying no word as yet; but the command was clear. “I do not say what threat will come,” said Professor Quirrell. “But you will not live all your lives in peace, not if the past history of the world is any guide at all to its future. And if you do in the future as you have seen three armies do this day, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickering and take the Mark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that the Dark Lord had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever Harry Potter was born—” “Enough!” bellowed Albus Dumbledore. There was silence. Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus Dum- bledore stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a soundless stress pressed down like weight upon all the students, as they listened not daring to move. “You, too, failed this country,” said Professor Quirrell. “And you know the peril as well as I.” “Such speeches are not for the ears of students,” said Albus Dumble- dore in a dangerously rising voice. “Nor for the mouths of professors!” Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: “There were many speeches made for the ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults clapped and cheered, and went home having enjoyed their day’s entertainment. But I will obey you, Headmaster, and make no further speeches if you do not like them. My lesson is simple. I will go on doing nothing about traitors, and we will see what students can do for themselves about that, when they do not wait for professors to save them.” And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and his mouth twitched up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the dreadful pressure like a god blowing to scatter the clouds. “But do please be kind to the traitors up until now,” said Professor Quirrell. “They were just having fun.” There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it seemed to build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly and some of the tension released itself. 594 COORDINATION PROBLEMS II 595 CH APTER 34 596 COORDINATION PROBLEMS II 597 CH APTER 34 598 COORDINATION PROBLEMS II The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic spout of fire blasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the sound of a hun- dred thunders. Draco hadn’t known Dumbledore could do that. The students sat down again very carefully and quietly. Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. “So be it, Mr Potter. Your will be done.” The Defence Professor paused deliberately. “Of course, I only promised one cunning plot. And that is all that the three of you will get.” Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they still came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger, they would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were directly opposed— “You mean,” said Harry, “we have to all agree on a wish?” “Oh, that would be far too much to ask,” said Professor Quirrell. “The three of you have no common enemy, do you?” And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might have imagined it, the Defence Professor’s eyes flicked in the direction of Dum- bledore. “No,” said Professor Quirrell, “I mean that I shall grant three wishes using a single plot.” There was a confused silence. “You can’t do that,” Harry said flatly from beside Draco. “Not even I can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually incompatible. It’s logically impossible—” and then Harry cut himself off. “You’re a few years too young to tell me what I can’t do, Mr Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile. Then the Defence Professor turned back to the watching students. “Truthfully, I have no confidence in your ability to learn this day’s lesson. Go home, and enjoy your time with your families, or what’s left of them, while they still live. My own family is long since dead at the Dark Lord’s hand. I shall see you all when classes resume.” In the speechless silence that resulted, Professor Quirrell already turn- ing to walk off the stage, Draco heard the Defence Professor’s voice say, quietly and no longer amplified, “But you, Mr Potter, I would speak to now.” CHAPTER THIRT Y-FI V E COORDINATION PROBLEMS, PART III They had gone to the Defence Professor’s office, and Professor Quir- rell had sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and spoke. The Defence Professor’s voice was very calm, and that unnerved Harry a good deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been shouting. “I am trying,” said Professor Quirrell quietly, “to make allowances for the fact that you are young. That I myself, at the same age, was a quite extraordinary fool. You speak with adult style and meddle in adult games, and sometimes I forget that you are only a meddler. I hope, Mr Potter, that your childish meddling has not just killed you, ruined your country, and lost the next war.” It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. “Professor Quirrell, I said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had to say something. Your proposals are extremely alarming to anyone who has the slightest familiarity with Muggle history over the last century. The Italian fascists, some very nasty people, got their name from the fasces, a bundle of rods bound together to symbolize the idea that unity is strength—” “So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger than divi- sion,” said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to creep into his voice. “Perhaps they also believed that the sky is blue, and advocated a policy of not dropping rocks on your head.” Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world’s stupidest person may say the sun is shining, but that doesn’t make it dark out… “Fine, you’re right, that was an ad hominem argument, it’s not wrong because the fascists said it. But Professor Quirrell, you can’t have everyone in a country take the Mark of one dictator! It’s a single point of failure! Look, I’ll put it this way. Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls the Mark—” “Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius,” said Professor Quirrell dryly. “And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in any case doomed. But worthy leaders do exist; the question is whether the people shall follow them.” Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wanted to call a time-out and make Professor Quirrell read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and then start the conversation over again. “I don’t suppose that if I suggested democracy was a better form of government than dictatorship—” “I see,” said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then opened. “Mr Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to you because you did not grow up revering the game. If you had never heard of elections, Mr Potter, and you simply saw what is there, what you saw would not please you. Look to our elected Minister of Magic. Is he the wisest, the strongest, the greatest of our nation? No; he is a buffoon who is owned in fee simple by Lucius Malfoy. Wizards went to the polls and chose between Cornelius Fudge and Tania Leach, who had competed with each other in a grand and entertaining contest after the Daily Prophet, which Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they were the only serious candidates. That Cor- nelius Fudge was genuinely selected as the best leader our country could offer is not a suggestion anyone could make with a straight face. It is no different in the Muggle world, from what I have heard and seen; the last Muggle newspaper I read mentioned that the previous President of the United States had been a retired film actor. If you had not grown up with elections, Mr Potter, they would be as transparently silly to you as Quid- ditch.” Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. “The point of elections isn’t to produce the one best leader, it’s to keep politicians scared enough of the voters that they don’t go completely evil like dicta- tors do—” “The last war, Mr Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and Dum- bledore. And while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing the war, it is ridiculous to suggest that any of the Ministers of Magic elected during that period could have taken Dumbledore’s place! Strength flows from powerful wizards and their followers, not from elections and the fools they elect. That is the lesson of magical Britain’s recent history; and I doubt that the next war will teach you a lesson any different. If you survive it, Mr Potter, which you will not do unless you abandon the enthusiastic illusions of childhood!” “If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you advo- cate,” said Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing sharp, “then that, too, is childish enthusiasm.” Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell’s eyes, who stared back without blinking. “Such dangers,” said Professor Quirrell coldly, “are to be discussed in offices like this one, not in speeches. The fools who elected Cornelius Fudge are not interested in complications and caution. Present them with anything more nuanced than a rousing cheer, and you will face your war alone. That, Mr Potter, was your childish error, which Draco Malfoy would not have made even when he was eight years old. It should have been ob- vious even to you that you should have stayed silent, and consulted with me first, not spoken your worries before the crowd!” “I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore,” said Harry, a cold in his voice to match Professor Quirrell’s. “But he is no child, and he did not seem to think my concerns were childish, nor that I should have waited to speak them.” “Oh,” said Professor Quirrell, “so you take your cues from the Head- master now, do you?” and stood up from behind his desk. 603 CH APTER 35 604 COORDINATION PROBLEMS III Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, “Go ahead, Mr Pot- ter.” Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed into his pouch. He was trembling with so much rage he could hardly speak. “He what? He did what?” “You should have deduced it yourself, Mr Potter,” Professor Quirrell said mildly. “You must learn to blur your vision until you can see the forest obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the stories about you, and who did not know that you were the mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could eas- ily deduce your ownership of an invisibility cloak. Step back from these events, blur away their details, and what do we observe? There was a great rivalry between students, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort of thing only happens in stories, Mr Potter, and there is one person in this school who thinks in stories. There was a strange and com- plicated plot, which you should have realized was uncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there is a person in this school who deals in plots that elaborate, and his name is not Zabini. And I did warn you that there was a quadruple agent; you knew that Zabini was at least a triple agent, and you should have guessed a high chance that it was he. No, I will not declare the battle invalid. All three of you failed the test, and lost to your common enemy.” Harry didn’t care about tests at this point. “Dumbledore blackmailed Zabini by threatening his cousin? Just to make our battle end in a tie? Why?” Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. “Perhaps the Headmaster thought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished to see it con- tinue. For the greater good, you understand. Or perhaps he was simply mad. You see, Mr Potter, everyone knows that Dumbledore’s madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to them that it is also possible to have a mask behind the mask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. And I am afraid, Mr Potter, that I have urgent business elsewhere, and must depart; but I should strongly advise you not to take your cues from Albus Dumbledore when fighting a war. Until later, Mr Potter.” And the Defence Professor inclined his head with some irony, and then strode off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry was still standing in open-mouthed shock. 606 COORDINATION PROBLEMS III 607 CH APTER 35 Aftermath: Blaise Zabini Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed slow- ness, his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down— “Ahem,” said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he passed. Blaise jumped, but he didn’t scream. Slowly, he turned. In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to determine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat, and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath. “Report,” whispered Mr Hat and Cloak. “I said just what you told me to,” said Blaise. His voice was a little calmer now that he wasn’t lying to anyone. “And Professor Quirrell re- acted just the way you expected.” The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head below had nodded. “Excellent,” said the unidentifiable whisper. “The reward I promised you is already on its way to your mother, by owl.” Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. “Can I ask now why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell and Dumble- dore?” The Headmaster hadn’t had anything to do with the Gryffindor bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping Kimberly, the Head- master had also offered to make Professor Binns give him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he turned in blank parchments for his home- work, though he’d still have to attend class and pretend to hand them in. Actually Blaise would have betrayed all three generals for free, and never mind his cousin either, but he’d seen no need to say that. The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a quizzical stare. “Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that traitors who betray so many times over often meet with ill ends?” “Nope,” said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under the hat. “Everyone knows that nothing really bad ever happens to students in Hog- warts.” Mr Hat and Cloak gave a whispering chuckle. “Indeed,” said the whis- per. “With the murder of one student five decades ago being the exception that proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have keyed his monster into the ancient wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself.” Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little uneasy. But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything significant to him without setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape were the only profes- sors who’d do something like this, and Quirrell wouldn’t care about fool- ing himself, and Snape wouldn’t hurt one of his own Slytherins…would he? “No, friend Blaise,” whispered the black mist, “I only wished to advise you never to try anything like this in your adult life. So many betrayals would certainly lead to at least one vengeance.” “My mother never got any vengeances,” said Blaise proudly. “Even though she married seven husbands and every single one of them died mysteriously and left her lots of money.” “Really?” said the whisper. “However did she persuade the seventh to marry her after he heard what happened to the first six?” “I asked Mum that,” said Blaise, “and she said I couldn’t know until I was old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and she said, older than her.” Again the whispering chuckle. “Well then, friend Blaise, my congrat- ulations on having followed in your mother’s footsteps. Go, and if you say nothing of this, we will not meet again.” Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn his back. The hat tilted. “Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were truly the equal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have already realized that my hinted threats were just to ensure your silence before Albus. Had I intended to harm, I would not have hinted; had I said nothing, then you should have worried.” Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to Mr Hat and Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his meeting with the Headmaster. He’d been hoping to the very end that someone else would show up and give him a chance to sell out Mr Hat and Cloak. But then Mum hadn’t betrayed seven different husbands at the same time. When you looked at it that way, he was still doing better than her. And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office, smiling, content to be a quintuple agent— For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking off the odd feeling of disorientation. And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster’s office, smiling, content to be a quadruple agent. 610 COORDINATION PROBLEMS III 611 CH APTER 35 612 COORDINATION PROBLEMS III Aftermath: Draco Malfoy Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that Sat- urday, not after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just sitting in an unused classroom and trying to read a book called Thinking Physics. It was one of the most fascinating things that Draco had ever read in his life, at least the parts he could understand, at least when the accursed idiot who refused to let his books out of his sight could manage to shut up and let Draco concentrate— “Hermione Granger is a muuudbloood,” sang Harry Potter from where he sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced book of his own. “I know what you’re trying to do,” said Draco calmly without looking up from the pages. “It’s not going to work. We’re still ganging up and crushing you.” “A Maaaalfoy is working with a muuudbloood, what will all your father’s frieeeends think—” “They’ll think Malfoys aren’t as easily manipulated as you seem to be- lieve, Potter!” The Defence Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no future saviour of the world could ever be this childish and undignified at any age. “Hey, Draco, you know what’s really going to suck? You know that Her- mione Granger has two copies of the magical allele, just like you and just like me, but all your classmates in Slytherin don’t know that and yooouuu’re not allowed to explaaaaain—” Draco’s fingers were whitening where they gripped the book. Being beaten and spat upon couldn’t possibly require this much self-control, and if he didn’t get back at Harry soon, he was going to do something incriminating— “So what did you wish the first time?” said Draco. Harry didn’t say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and felt a twinge of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry’s face. “Um,” Harry said. “A lot of people asked me that, but I don’t think Pro- fessor Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about it.” Draco put a serious look on his own face. “You can talk about it with me. It’s probably not important compared to the other secrets you’ve told me, and what else are friends for?” That’s right, I’m your friend! Feel guilty! “It wasn’t really all that interesting,” Harry said with obviously artifi- cial lightness. “Just, I wish Professor Quirrell would teach Battle Magic again next year.” Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book. And said, after another few seconds, “Your father’s probably going to be pretty upset with you this Christmas, but if you promise him that you’ll betray the mudblood girl and wipe out her army, everything will go back to being all right, and you’ll still get your Christmas presents.” Maybe if he and Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely and used some of their Quirrell points, the two of them would be allowed to do something more interesting to General Chaos than putting him to sleep. CHAPTER THIRT Y-SIX STATUS DIFFERE NTIALS Wrenching disorientation, that was how it felt to walk out of Plat- form Nine-and-Three-Quarters into the rest of Earth, the world that Harry had once thought was the only real world. People dressed in casual shirts and trousers, instead of the more dignified robes of wizards and witches. Scattered bits of trash here and there around the benches. A forgotten smell, the fumes of burned gasoline, raw and sharp in the air. The ambiance of the King’s Cross train station, less bright and cheer- ful than Hogwarts or Diagon Alley; the people seemed smaller, more afraid, and likely would have eagerly traded their problems for a dark wizard to fight. Harry wanted to cast Scourgify for the dirt, and Everto for the garbage, and if he’d known the spell, a Bubble-Head Charm so he wouldn’t have to breathe the air. But he couldn’t use his wand, in this place… This, Harry realized, must be what it felt like to go from a First World country to a Third World country. Only it was the Zeroth World which Harry had left, the wizarding world, of Cleansing Charms and house elves; where, between the healer’s arts and your own magic, you could hit one hundred and seventy before old age really started catching up with you. And non-magical London, Muggle Earth, to which Harry had tem- porarily returned. This was where Mum and Dad would live out the rest of their lives, unless technology leapfrogged over wizardry’s quality of life, or something deeper in the world changed. Without even thinking about it, Harry’s head turned and his eyes darted behind him to see the wooden trunk that was scurrying after him, unnoticed by any Muggles, the clawed tentacles offering quick confirmation that, yes, he hadn’t just imagined it all… And then there was the other reason for the tight feeling in his chest. His parents didn’t know. They didn’t know anything. They didn’t know… “Harry?” called a thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth and un- blemished skin made her look a good deal younger than thirty-three; and Harry realized with a start that it was magic, he hadn’t known the signs before but he could see them now. And whatever sort of potion lasted that long, it must have been terribly dangerous, because most witches didn’t do that to themselves, they weren’t that desperate… There was water gathering in Harry’s eyes. “Harry?” yelled an older-looking man with a paunch gathering about his stomach, dressed with ostentatious academic carelessness in a black waistcoat thrown over a dark grey-green shirt, someone who would al- ways be a professor anywhere he went, who would certainly have been one of the most brilliant wizards of his generation, if he’d been born with two copies of that gene, instead of zero… Harry raised his hand and waved to them. He couldn’t speak. He couldn’t speak at all. They came over to him, not running, but at a steady, dignified walk; that was how fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, and Mrs Petu- nia Evans-Verres wasn’t about to walk any faster. The smile on his father’s face wasn’t very wide, but then his father never was given to huge smiles; it was, at least, as wide as Harry had ever seen it, wider than when a new grant came in, or when one of his students got a position, and you couldn’t ask for a wider smile than that. Mum was blinking hard, and she was trying to smile but not doing a very good job. “So!” said his father as he came striding up. “Made any revolutionary discoveries yet?” Of course Dad thought he was joking. It hadn’t hurt quite so much when his parents didn’t believe in him, back when no-one else had believed in him either, back when Harry hadn’t known how it felt to be taken seriously by people like Headmaster Dumble- dore and Professor Quirrell. And that was when Harry realized that the Boy-Who-Lived only ex- isted in magical Britain, that there wasn’t any such person in Muggle Lon- don, just a cute little eleven-year-old boy going home for Christmas. “Excuse me,” Harry said, his voice trembling, “I’m going to break down and cry now, it doesn’t mean there was anything wrong at school.” Harry started to move forward, and then stopped, torn between hug- ging his father and hugging his mother, he didn’t want either one to feel slighted or that Harry loved them more than the other— “You,” said his father, “are a very silly boy, Mr Verres,” and he gently took Harry by the shoulders and pushed him into the arms of his mother, who was kneeling down, tears already streaking her cheek. “Hello, Mum,” Harry said with his voice wavering, “I’m back.” And he hugged her, amid the noisy mechanical sounds and the smell of burned gasoline; and Harry started crying, because he knew that nothing could go back, least of all him. 617 CH APTER 36 Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things that he couldn’t just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had said that Harry would need to walk or take the bus, which had suited Harry just fine. Some of the people at the hardware store had given Harry question- ing looks, but he’d said with an innocent voice that his father was shop- ping nearby and was very busy and had sent him to get some things (hold- ing up a list in carefully adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and in the end, money was money. They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry had put a tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at Gambol & Japes). Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but they didn’t seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities of gold into tax-free, clean Muggle money in a numbered Swiss bank account. This had rather spiked Harry’s plan to turn most of the money he’d self-stolen into a sensible mix of 60% international index funds and 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For the moment, Harry had diversified his assets a little fur- ther by sneaking out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, and bury- ing one hundred golden Galleons in the backyard. He’d always always al- ways wanted to do that anyway. Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor reading Harry’s books and asking questions. Most of the experiments his father had suggested were impractical, at least for the moment; of those remain- ing, Harry had done many of them already. (“Yes, Dad, I checked what happened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciation and she didn’t know whether it was changed, that was the very first experiment I did, Dad!”) The last question Harry’s father had asked, looking up from Magi- cal Draughts and Potions with an expression of bewildered disgust, was whether it all made sense if you were a wizard; and Harry had answered no. Whereupon his father had declared that magic was unscientific. Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a section of reality and calling it unscientific. Dad seemed to think that the conflict between his intuitions and the universe meant that the universe had a problem. (Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that quantum mechanics was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being normal and them being weird.) Harry had shown his mother the healer’s kit he’d bought to keep in their house, though most of the potions wouldn’t work on Dad. Mum had stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether Mum’s sis- ter had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin and Grandma Elaine. And when Mum still hadn’t answered, Harry had said hastily that she must have just never thought of it. And then, finally, he’d fled the room. Lily Evans probably hadn’t thought of it, that was the sad thing. Harry knew that other people had a tendency to not think about painful subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to deliberately rest their hands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry was starting to suspect that most Muggle-borns rapidly acquired a tendency to not think about their family, who were all going to die before they reached their first century anyway. Not that Harry had any intention of letting that happen, of course. And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were driving off for their Christmas Eve dinner. 62 0 STATUS DIFFERE NTIALS Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner approached. The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to the common project, were steadily cooking away in the oven; the other dishes were to be brought by their guests, the Verres family, who had adopted a boy named Harry. Who was known to the wizarding world as the Boy-Who-Lived. And who was also the only boy that Hermione had ever called “cute”, or noticed at all, really. The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in Harry’s age group whose existence their son had ever acknowledged in any way what- soever. And it might’ve been jumping the gun just a little; but both couples had a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the offing a few years down the road. So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her husband’s family, they’d decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting their daughter’s possible future in-laws. The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting the turkey, and she raised her voice and shouted, “Honey, can you get it?” There was a brief groan of a chair and its occupant, and then there was the sound of her husband’s heavy footsteps and the door swinging open. “Mr Granger?” said an older man’s brisk voice. “I’m Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry. The food’s in the magical trunk.” “Yes, please, come in,” said her husband, followed by a muttered “Thank you” that indicated some sort of present had been accepted, and “Have a seat.” Then Leo’s voice altered to a tone of artificial enthusiasm, and said, “And all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I’m sure Herm will be down shortly, it’s the first door on your right.” There was a brief pause. Then a young boy’s bright voice said, “Toys? I love toys!” There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then the same bright voice said, “Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I don’t get lost in here!” Roberta closed up the oven, smiling. She’d been a bit worried about the way Hermione’s letters had described the Boy-Who-Lived—though certainly her daughter hadn’t said anything indicating that Harry Potter was dangerous; nothing like the dark hints written in the books Roberta had bought, supposedly for Hermione, during their trip to Diagon Alley. Her daughter hadn’t said much at all, only that Harry talked like he came out of a book, and Hermione was studying harder than she ever had in her life just to stay ahead of him in class. But from the sound of it, Harry Potter was an ordinary eleven-year-old boy. She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering franti- cally down the stairs at a speed that didn’t look safe at all, Hermione had claimed that witches were more resistant to falls but Roberta wasn’t quite sure she believed that— Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs Verres, who were both looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the legendary scar on his forehead turned to her daughter and said, now in a lower voice, “Well met on this fairest of evenings, Miss Granger.” His hand stretched back, as though offering his parents on a silver platter. “I present to you my father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and my mother, Mrs Petunia Evans-Verres.” And as Roberta’s mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to his parents and said, now in that bright voice again, “Mum, Dad, this is Her- mione! She’s really smart!” “Harry!” hissed her daughter. “Stop that!” The boy swivelled again to regard Hermione. “I’m afraid, Miss Gran- ger,” the boy said gravely, “that you and I have been exiled to the labyrinthine recesses of the basement. Let us leave them to their adult conversations, which would no doubt soar far above our own childish intellects, and resume our ongoing discussion of the implications of Humean projectivism for Transfiguration.” “Excuse us, please,” said her daughter in a very firm tone, and grabbed the boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the hallway—Roberta swiv- elled helplessly to track them as they went past her, the boy gave her a cheery wave—and then Hermione pulled the boy into the basement access and slammed the door behind her. “I, ah, I apologize for…” said Mrs Verres in a faltering voice. “I’m sorry,” said the Professor, smiling fondly, “Harry can be a bit touchy about that sort of thing. But I expect he’s right about us not being interested in their conversation.” Is he dangerous? Roberta wanted to ask, but she kept her silence and tried to think of subtler questions. Her husband beside her was chuckling, as if he’d found what they’d just seen funny, rather than frightening. The most terrible Dark Lord in history had tried to kill that boy, and the burnt husk of his body had been found next to the crib. Her possible future son-in-law. Roberta had been increasingly apprehensive about giving her daugh- ter over to witchcraft—especially after she’d read the books, put the dates together, and realized that her magical mother had probably been killed at the height of Grindelwald’s terror, not died giving birth to her as her father had always claimed. But Professor McGonagall had made other visits after her first trip, to “see how Miss Granger is doing”; and Roberta couldn’t help but think that if Hermione said her parents were being troublesome about her witching career, something would be done to fix them… Roberta put her best smile on her face, and did what she could to spread some pretended Christmas cheer. 624 STATUS DIFFERE NTIALS 625 CH APTER 36 626 STATUS DIFFERE NTIALS Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the Boy-Who- Lived out of the room with a patient look upon her young face. “I’m terribly sorry,” said Professor Verres with an amused smile. “But please don’t worry, Harry always talks like that. Aren’t they just like a mar- ried couple already?” The frightening thing was that they were. 627 CH APTER 36 The conversation had only just started again when a distant high- pitched yelp floated back to them, “Hey! No kissing!” The two fathers burst out in laughter just as the two mothers rose up from their chairs with identical looks of horror and dashed toward the basement. When the children had been brought back, Hermione was saying in an icy tone that she was never going to kiss Harry ever again, and Harry was saying in an outraged voice that the Sun would burn down to a cold dead cinder before he let her get close enough to try. Which meant that everything was just the way it should be, and they all sat back down again to finish their Christmas dinner. CHAPTER THIRT Y-SE V EN INTERLUDE: CROSSING THE BOUNDARY It was almost midnight. Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn’t used the Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep cycle to make sure he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into Christmas Day; because while he’d never been young enough to believe in Santa Claus, he’d once been young enough to doubt. It would have been nice if there had been a mysterious figure who en- tered your house in the night and brought you presents… A chill went down Harry’s spine then. An intimation of something dreadful approaching. A creeping terror. A sense of doom. Harry sat bolt upright in bed. He looked at the window. “Professor Quirrell?” Harry shrieked very quietly. Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry’s window seemed to fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter blew into the room through the gap, along with a scant few flakes of snow from a sky spotted with grey night-clouds, amid the black and stars. “Fear not, Mr Potter,” said the Defence Professor in a normal voice. “I have Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake until I have de- parted.” “No-one’s supposed to know where I am!” said Harry, still keeping the shriek quiet. “Even owls are supposed to deliver my mail to Hogwarts, not here!” Harry had agreed to that willingly; it would be silly if a Death Eater could win the whole war at any time just by owling him a magically trig- gered hand grenade. Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the back- yard beyond the window. “Oh, I shouldn’t worry, Mr Potter. You are well protected against locating Charms, and no blood purist is likely to think of consulting a phone book.” His grin grew wider. “And it did take con- siderable effort to cross the wards that the Headmaster put around this house—though of course anyone who knew your address could simply wait outside and attack you the next time you left.” Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. “What are you doing here?” Harry said finally. The smile left Professor Quirrell’s face. “I’ve come to apologize, Mr Pot- ter,” the Defence Professor said quietly. “I should not have spoken to you so harshly as I—” “Don’t,” Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was clutch- ing around his pyjamas. “Just don’t.” “Have I offended you that much?” said Professor Quirrell’s quiet voice. “No,” Harry said. “But you will if you apologize.” “I see,” said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice grew stern. “Then if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr Potter, I should say that you have gravely violated the etiquette that holds between friendly Slytherins. If you are not currently playing the game against someone, you must not meddle in their plans like that, not without asking them before. For you do not know what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose. It would mark you as their enemy, Mr Potter.” “I’m sorry,” Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that Professor Quir- rell had used. “Apology accepted,” said Professor Quirrell. “But,” Harry said, still quietly, “you and I really must speak further on politics, at some point.” Professor Quirrell sighed. “I know you dislike condescension, Mr Potter—” That was a bit of an understatement. “But it would be even more condescending,” said Professor Quirrell, “if I were not to state it clearly. You are missing some life experience, Mr Potter.” “And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with you, then?” said Harry calmly. “What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?” said Professor Quirrell, and shrugged. “I think you will change your mind in time, after every trust you place has failed you, and you have become cyn- ical.” The Defence Professor said it as though it were the most ordinary statement in the world, framed against the black and the stars and the cloud-spotted sky, as one or two tiny snowflakes blew past him in the biting winter air. “That reminds me,” said Harry. “Merry Christmas.” “I suppose,” said Professor Quirrell. “After all, if it is not an apology, then it must be a Christmas gift. The very first one I have ever given, in fact.” Harry hadn’t even started yet on learning Latin so he could read the experimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his mouth to ask. “Put on your winter coat,” said Professor Quirrell, “or take a warming potion if you have one; and meet me outside, under the stars. I shall see if I can maintain it a little longer this time.” It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was dashing for the wardrobe. Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more than an hour, though the Defence Professor’s face grew strained, and he had to sit down after a while. Harry protested only once, and was shushed. They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day within that timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing, the one true everlasting Silent Night. And just as promised, Harry’s parents slept soundly all through it, un- til Harry was safely back in his room, and the Defence Professor had gone. Part III Harry James Potter- Evans-Verres and the Shadows of Death CHAPTER THIRT Y-EIGHT THE CARDINAL SIN Bright the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright their par- ents, clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter Sun hang- ing low in the sky at 9:45 a.m. in the morning on January 5th, 1992. Some of the younger students wore scarves and mittens, but most simply wore their robes; they were wizards, after all. After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took off his scarf and coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and stowed away his winter things. For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite at him, just to see what it was like. Harry took out his wizards’ robes, shrugged them on. And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn’t help thinking of the parents he’d only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose problems he was leaving behind… With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said, “Ther- mos.” The warmth flowed through him. And the Boy-Who-Lived was back. Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything else at the conclusion of his holiday. He didn’t feel like reading his text- books, or even any serious science fiction, this morning; what he needed was something completely frivolous to occupy his attention… Well, that wouldn’t be hard to come by, if he was willing to part with four Knuts. Besides, if the Daily Prophet was corrupt and the Quibbler was the only competing newspaper, there might be some suppressed real news in there. Harry trudged back over to the same news-stand from last time, won- dering if the Quibbler could top the headline he’d seen before. The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the man’s face suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar. “Harry Potter?” gasped the vendor. “No, Mr Durian,” said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man’s name- tag, “just an amazing imitation—” And then Harry’s voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight of the top fold of the Quibbler. Sloshed Seer Spills Secrets: Dark Lord To Return, For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face, before re- alizing that not being shocked could be just as revealing, in a sense— “Excuse me,” Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and he didn’t even know whether that was too revealing, or just what his normal reaction would be if he didn’t know anything. He’d spent too much time around Slytherins, he was forgetting how to keep secrets from ordinary people. Four Knuts hit the counter. “One copy of the Quibbler, please.” “Oh, no worries, Mr Potter!” said the vendor hastily, waving his hands. “It’s—never mind, just—” A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry’s fingers, and he un- folded it. Sloshed Seer Spills Secrets: Dark Lord To Return, Wed Draco Malfoy “It’s free,” said the vendor, “for you, I mean—” “No,” Harry said, “I was going to buy one anyway.” The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on. “Gosh,” Harry said half a minute later, “you get a seer smashed on six slugs of Scotch and she spills all sorts of secret stuff. I mean, who’d have thought that Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were secretly the same per- son?” “Not me,” said the vendor. “They’ve even got a picture of the two of them together, so we know who it is that’s secretly the same person.” “Yup,” said the vendor. “Pretty clever disguise, innit?” “And I’m secretly sixty-five years old.” “You don’t look half that,” the vendor said amiably. “And I’m betrothed to Hermione Granger, and Bellatrix Black, and Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy too…” “Goin’ ter be one interesting wedding,” said the vendor. Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant voice, “You know, I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane, and I won- dered if she really was, or if she was just making stuff up and giggling to herself the whole time. Then when I read my second Quibbler headline, I decided that she couldn’t be insane, I mean, it can’t be easy to make this stuff up, you couldn’t do it by accident. And now do you know what I think? I think she must be mad after all. When ordinary people try to make stuff up, it doesn’t come out like this. Something’s got to go really wrong with the inside of your head before this is what comes out when you start mak- ing stuff up!” The vendor stared at Harry. “Seriously,” said Harry. “Who reads this stuff?” “You,” said the vendor. Harry wandered off to read his newspaper. He didn’t sit at the same nearby table he’d sat down at with Draco, the first time he’d prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself. It wasn’t just that his first term at Hogwarts had been, judging by the Quibbler, fifty-four years long. It was that, in Harry’s humble opinion, his life did not need any new threads of complexity. So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from the main crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents Apparating in with their children, and sat down and read the Quibbler to see if it con- tained any suppressed news. And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any of that was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic gossip; but nothing that would really be all that important if it was true. Harry was just reading about the Ministry’s proposed marriage law, to ban all marriages, when— “Harry Potter,” said a silken voice that sent a shock of adrenaline jolt- ing through Harry’s blood. Harry looked up. “Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was going to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of King’s Cross until 10:55 a.m. Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hair drift- ing over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that same cane, lac- quered in black with a silver snake’s head for its handle; and something about his grip silently said this is a weapon of deadly power, not I am feeble and leaning on this. His face was expressionless. Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wands already gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved like a single organism with four legs and four arms, the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was which, but then it didn’t really matter. They were merely Lucius’s appendages, as certainly as if they’d been the two rightmost toes on his left foot. “I apologize for disturbing you, Mr Potter,” said the smooth, silken voice. “But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, might be my only opportunity to meet you.” “I have received none of your owls,” Harry said calmly. “Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would not have answered them if I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with you directly, without Draco’s knowledge, would trespass on our friendship.” Please go away, please go away… The grey eyes glittered at him. “Is that your pose, then…” said the se- nior Malfoy. “Well. I shall play along a little. What was your purpose in manœuvring your good friend, my son, into a public alliance with that girl?” “Oh,” Harry said lightly, “that’s obvious, right? Draco’s working with Granger will make him realize that Muggle-borns are human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha.” A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius’s lips. “Yes, that does sound like one of Dumbledore’s plans. Which it is not.” “Indeed,” said Harry. “It is part of my game with Draco, and no work of Dumbledore’s, and that is all I will say.” “Let us dispense with games,” said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly hardening. “If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore’s bidding in any case, Mr Potter.” There was a slight pause. “So you know,” Harry said, his voice cold. “Tell me. At which point, exactly, did you realize?” “When I read your response to Professor Quirrell’s little speech,” said the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. “I was puzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took me days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you are weak, in some ways if not others.” “Very clever of you,” said Harry, still cold. “But perhaps you mistake my interests.” “Perhaps I do.” A hint of steel came into the silken voice. “Indeed, that is precisely what I fear. You are playing strange games with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess. That is not a friendly act, and you cannot but expect me to be concerned!” Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both those hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed. Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad idea to show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated. They were in a public train station anyway— “I find it interesting,” Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, “that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius. He is my friend, and I do not betray my friends.” “What?” whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock. Then— “Company,” said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the voice, that it must be the senior Crabbe. Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of disapproval. Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow be- hind a tall woman who didn’t look scared at all. “Madam Longbottom,” Lucius said icily. “Mr Malfoy,” returned the woman with equal ice. “Are you being an annoyance to our Harry Potter?” The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely bitter. “Oh, I rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have you?” The white-haired head shifted toward Neville. “And this would be Mr Pot- ter’s loyal lieutenant, the last scion of Longbottom, Neville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the world turn. Sometimes I think it must all be mad.” Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked con- fused, and frightened. “I doubt it is the world that is mad,” said Madam Longbottom. Her voice took on a gloating tone. “You seem in a poor mood, Mr Malfoy. Did the speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a few allies?” “It was a clever enough slander of my abilities,” Lucius said coldly, “though only effective upon the fools who believe that I was truly a Death Eater.” “What?” blurted Neville. “I was under the Imperius, young man,” said Lucius, now sounding tired. “The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting among pure- blood families without the support of House Malfoy. I demurred, and he simply made sure of me. His own Death Eaters did not know it until after- wards, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me. Some of the Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and for the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them controlled. But I was not such a fool as to support that ill- fated adventurer of my own choice—” “Ignore him,” Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed to Harry as well as Neville. “He must spend the rest of his life pretending, for fear of your testimony under Veritaserum.” Said with malicious satisfac- tion. Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again. “Will you request this harridan to depart, Mr Potter?” “I think not,” said Harry in a dry voice. “I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that’s my own age.” There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him. “Of course…” said Lucius slowly. “I do feel the fool now. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about.” Harry met the gaze, and said nothing. Lucius raised his cane a few centimetres and struck it hard on the ground. The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there was nothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snake- headed cane. “My son is my heart,” said the senior Malfoy, “the last worthwhile thing I have left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son does not come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours. And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of you.” Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbot- tom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wand was in her hand, now. “How dare you!” she hissed. Lucius’s dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as he turned to the senior Goyle. “We return to Malfoy Manor.” There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone. A silence followed. “Dear heavens,” said Madam Longbottom. “What was that about?” Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville. There was sweat on Neville’s forehead. “Thank you very much, Neville,” said Harry. “Your help was greatly ap- preciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should sit down.” “Yes, General,” said Neville, and instead of coming over to one of the other chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting position on the pavement. “You have wrought many changes in my grandson,” said Madam Long- bottom. “I approve of some, but not others.” “Send me the list of which is which,” said Harry. “I’ll see what I can do.” Neville groaned, but said nothing. Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. “I shall, young man, thank you.” Her voice lowered. “Mr Potter…the speech given by Professor Quirrell is something our nation has long needed to hear. I cannot say as much of your comment on it.” “I will take your opinion under advisement,” Harry said mildly. “I dearly hope that you do,” said Madam Longbottom, and turned back to her grandson. “Do I still need to—” “It’s okay for you to go, Granma,” said Neville. “I’ll be fine on my own, this time.” “Now that I approve of,” she said, and popped and vanished like a soap bubble. The two boys sat quietly for a moment. Neville spoke first, his voice weary. “You’re going to try to fix all the changes she approves of, right?” “Not all of them,” Harry said innocently. “I just want to make sure I’m not corrupting you.” 642 THE CARDINAL SIN 643 645 CH APTER 39 646 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE I It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather demanded, that his students test their skills against an actual Dementor after they learned the words and gestures to the Patronus Charm. “Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm himself,” said Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices. “Which is never a good sign. But then, he volunteered that fact to me in the course of demand- ing that outside instructors be brought in to teach the Patronus Charm to every student who wished to learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I would not. This impressed me greatly. But now he insists on bringing in a Dementor—” “Headmaster,” Harry said quietly, “Professor Quirrell believes very strongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat conditions. Wanting to bring in an actual Dementor is completely in character for him.” Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look. “In character?” said the old wizard. “I mean,” said Harry, “it’s entirely consistent with the way Professor Quirrell usually acts…” Harry trailed off. Why had he put it that way? The Headmaster nodded. “So you have the same sense I do; that it is an excuse. A very reasonable excuse, to be sure; more so than you may realize. Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a Patronus Charm will succeed in the presence of an actual Dementor, going from not a single flicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus. Why this should be, no-one knows; but it is so.” Harry frowned. “Then I really don’t see why you’re suspicious—” The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness. “Harry, the Defence Professor has asked me to pass the darkest of all creatures through the gates of Hogwarts. I must be suspicious.” The Headmaster sighed. “And yet the Dementor will be guarded, warded, in a mighty cage, I will be there myself to watch it at all times—I cannot think of what ill could be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it. And so I am asking you.” Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was so shocked he couldn’t even feel flattered. “Me?” said Harry. “Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I try my best to anticipate my foes, to encompass their wicked minds and predict their evil thoughts. But I would never have imagined sharpening a Hufflepuff’s bones into weapons.” Was Harry ever going to live that down? “Headmaster,” Harry said wearily, “I know it doesn’t sound good, but in all seriousness: I’m not evil, I’m just very creative—” “I did not say that you were evil,” Dumbledore said seriously. “There are those who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil; but they are merely pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which does not know love, and dares not imagine love, and cannot ever understand love without ceasing to be evil. And I suspect that you can imagine your way into the minds of Dark Wizards better than I ever could, while still knowing love yourself. So, Harry.” The Headmaster’s eyes were intent. “If you stood in Professor Quirrell’s shoes, what misdeeds could you accomplish after you tricked me into allowing a Dementor onto the grounds of Hogwarts?” “Hold on,” said Harry, and in something of a daze trudged over to the chair in front of the Headmaster’s desk, and sat down. It was a large and comfortable chair this time, not a wooden stool, and Harry could feel him- self enveloped as he sank into it. Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell. Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of Dum- bledore. Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defence Professor was plan- ning to do something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry ought to be helping the Headmaster prevent it. Point three… “Headmaster,” Harry said, “if Professor Quirrell is up to something, I’m not sure I can outwit him. He’s got a lot more experience than I do.” The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear very solemn despite his smile. “You underestimate yourself.” That was the first time anyone had ever said that to Harry. “I remember,” the old wizard continued, “a young man in this very office, cold and controlled as he faced down the Head of House Slytherin, blackmailing his own Headmaster to protect his classmates. And I believe that young man is more cunning than Professor Quirrell, more cunning than Lucius Malfoy, that he will grow to be the equal of Voldemort himself. It is he whom I wish to consult.” Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name, frowned thoughtfully at the Headmaster. How much does he know…? The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious dark side, as deep as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still remembered what it had been like to watch, invisibly Time-Turned, as his past self faced down the older Slytherins; the boy with the scar on his forehead who didn’t act like the others. Of course the Headmaster would have noticed something odd about the boy in his office… And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning to match his destined foe, the Dark Lord. Which wasn’t asking for very much, considering that the Dark Lord had put a clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants’ left arms, and that he’d slaughtered the entire monastery that taught the martial art he’d wanted to learn. Enough cunning to match Professor Quirrell would be a whole different order of problem. But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort of answer that sounded impressively cunning…which had better not actually get in the way of Professor Quirrell’s teaching Defence… And of course Harry would go over to his dark side and think it through from that direction, just to be honest, and just in case. “Tell me,” Harry said, “everything about how the Dementor is to be brought in, and how it is to be guarded.” Dumbledore’s eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizard began to speak. The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts by an Auror trio, all three personally known to the Headmaster, and all three able to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be met at the edge of the grounds by Dumbledore, who would pass the Dementor through the Hogwarts wards— Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary—whether some- one could just bring in the same Dementor again the next day. The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approving nod), and the explanation went on: the Dementor would be in a cage of solid titanium bars, not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a Demen- tor’s presence would corrode that metal to dust, but not in a single day. Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the Dementor, behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the three Aurors at any given time. Dumbledore would wait by the Dementor’s cage with his Patronus. A single student would approach the Dementor; and Dum- bledore would dispel his Patronus; and the student would attempt to cast their own Patronus Charm; and if they failed, Dumbledore would restore his Patronus before the student could suffer any permanent damage. Past duelling champion Professor Flitwick would also be present while there were students near, just to add safety margin. “Why just you waiting by the Dementor?” said Harry. “I mean, shouldn’t it be you plus an Auror—” The Headmaster shook his head. “They could not withstand the re- peated exposure to the Dementor, each time I dispel my Patronus.” And if Dumbledore’s Patronus did fail for some reason, while one of the students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would cast an- other corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the student… Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn’t see a flaw in the security. So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed his eyes, and remembered: “And that will be…five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from Raven- claw for backchat.” The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn’t been calling much on his dark side lately… Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his mind, before his blood chilled into something approaching deadly crystalline clarity. And then he thought of the Dementor. And it was obvious. “The Dementor is a distraction,” Harry said. The coldness clear in his voice, since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected. “A large, salient threat, but in the end straightforward, and easy to defend against. So while all your attention is focused on the Dementor, the real plot will be happening elsewhere.” Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow nod. “Yes…” said the Headmaster. “And I do believe I know what it might be a distraction from, if Professor Quirrell means ill…thank you, Harry.” The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in those an- cient eyes. “What?” said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold still lingering in his blood. “I have another question for that young man,” said the Headmaster. “It is something I have long wondered to myself, yet been unable to com- prehend. Why?” There was a tinge of pain in his voice. “Why would anyone deliberately make himself a monster? Why do evil for the sake of evil? Why Voldemort?” 652 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE I 653 CH APTER 39 654 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE I Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble— “What?” said Dumbledore. “Death is bad,” said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of clear communication. “Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of death is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem.” The Headmaster was staring at him as though he’d just turned into a cat. “Okay,” said Harry, “let me put it this way. Do you want to die? Because if so, there’s this Muggle thing called a suicide prevention hotline—” “When it is time,” the old wizard said quietly. “Not before. I would never seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it comes.” Harry was frowning sternly. “That doesn’t sound like you have a very strong will to live, Headmaster!” “Harry…” The old wizard’s voice was starting to sound a little helpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard, unnoticed, had drifted into a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. “I think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager to live. They fear death. They do not reach up toward the sun’s light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker caverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life they desire, but immortality; and they are so driven to grasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want to live forever, Harry?” “Yes, and so do you,” said Harry. “I want to live one more day. Tomor- row I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don’t want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you don’t want to live forever, it means you want to die. You’ve got to do one or the other…I’m not getting through here, am I.” The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of incommen- surability. “I have lived a hundred and ten years,” the old wizard said quietly (tak- ing his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake out the colour). “I have seen and done a great many things, too many of which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret being alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it does! What would you do with eternity, Harry?” Harry took a deep breath. “Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write something even better, celebrate my first grandchild’s tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild’s hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with ev- eryone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way once we’ve explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I’m a lot more hopeful now that I’ve discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines.” “I did not understand much of that,” said Dumbledore. “But I must ask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately, or if you only imagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as you run and run from death.” “Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you’re allowed to die,” Harry said firmly. “It’s life, you just go on living it. If I’m not doing those things it’ll be because I’ve found something better.” Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they touched it, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and the hands briefly appeared in different positions. “In the unlikely event that I am permitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty,” said the old wizard, “I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years would be entirely too much of a good thing.” “Yes, well,” Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mum and Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn’t do something about it, “I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature as dying at, say, eighty.” Harry’s voice went hard, on that last word. “Perhaps,” the old wizard said peacefully. “I would not wish to die be- fore my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The hardest time is when those you loved the most have gone on before you, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay…” Dumbledore’s eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. “Do not mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with those I have long missed, on our next great adventure.” “Oh!” Harry said in sudden realization. “You believe in an afterlife. I got the impression wizards didn’t have religion?” 658 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE I 659 CH APTER 39 660 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE I 661 CH APTER 39 Tick, crackle, fzzzt… Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and stared at Harry with his mouth gaping open dumbly. (Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he’d managed to blow someone’s mind completely before the day was over.) “And in case it wasn’t clear,” said Harry, “by everyone I mean all Muggles too, not just all wizards.” “No,” said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose. “No, no, no! This is insanity!” “Bwa ha ha!” said Harry. The old wizard’s face was tight with anger and worry. “Voldemort stole the book from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there when I went to look for it. But this much I know, and this much I will tell you: his immor- tality was born of a ritual terrible and Dark, blacker than pitchest black! And it was Myrtle, poor sweet Myrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took murder—” “Well obviously I’m not going to popularize a method of immortality that requires killing people! That would defeat the entire point!” There was a startled pause. Slowly the old wizard’s face relaxed out of its anger, though the worry was still there. “You would use no ritual requiring human sacrifice.” “I don’t know what you take me for, Headmaster,” Harry said coldly, his own anger rising, “but let’s not forget that I’m the one who wants people to live! The one who wants to save everyone! You’re the one who thinks death is awesome and everyone ought to die!” “I am at a loss, Harry,” said the old wizard. His feet once more began trudging across his strange office. “I know not what to say.” He picked up a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames, looked into it with a sad expression. “Only that I am greatly misunderstood by you…I don’t want everyone to die, Harry!” “You just don’t want anyone to be immortal,” Harry said with consid- erable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies like All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x) were beyond the reasoning abilities of the world’s most powerful wizard. The old wizard nodded. “I am less afraid than I was, but still greatly worried for you, Harry,” he said quietly. His hand, a little wizened by time, but still strong, placed the crystal ball firmly back into its stand. “For the fear of death is a bitter thing, an illness of the soul by which people are twisted and warped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go down that bleak road, though I fear he has taken it further than any before him.” “And you think you’re not afraid of death?” Harry said, not even trying to mask the incredulity in his voice. The old wizard’s face was peaceful. “I am not perfect, Harry, but I think I have accepted my death as part of myself.” “Uh huh,” Harry said. “See, there’s this little thing called cognitive dis- sonance, or in plainer English, sour grapes. If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a month, and no-one could do anything about it, pretty soon there’d be all sorts of philosophers, pretending to be wise as you put it, who found all sorts of amazing benefits to being hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you’re not getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to someone who wasn’t getting hit, and you asked them if they wanted to start, in exchange for those amazing benefits, they’d say no. And if you didn’t have to die, if you came from somewhere that no-one had ever even heard of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an amazing wonderful great idea for people to get wrinkled and old and eventu- ally cease to exist, why, you’d have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone possibly think any thought so silly as that death is a good thing? Because you’re afraid of it, because you don’t really want to die, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won’t have to think about it—” “No, Harry,” the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand trailed through a lighted pool of water that made small musical chimes as his fingers stirred it. “Though I can understand how you must think so.” “Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?” Harry said, his voice now hard and grim. “Then look within the part of yourself that flees not from death but from the fear of death, that finds that fear so unbearable that it will embrace Death as a friend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night so that it can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most terrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist that same part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it friendship. If you can call death better than life then you can twist your moral compass to point anywhere—” “I think,” said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand to the sound of tiny tinkling bells, “that you understand Dark Wizards very well, without yet being one yourself.” It was said in perfect seriousness, and without accusation. “But your comprehension of me, I fear, is sorely lacking.” The old wizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter in his voice. Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from some- where there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of resentment, at Dumbledore’s condescension, and all the laughter that wise old fools had ever used in place of argument. “Funny thing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be this impossible to talk to, and instead, in his child- ish innocence, he was a hundred times stronger than you.” A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard’s face. “What do you mean?” “I mean,” Harry said, his voice biting, “that Draco actually took his own beliefs seriously and processed my words instead of throwing them out the win- dow by smiling with gentle superiority. You’re so old and wise, you can’t even notice anything I’m saying! Not understand, notice!” “I have listened to you, Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking more solemn now, “but to listen is not always to agree. Disagreements aside, what is it that you think I do not comprehend?” That if you really believed in an afterlife, you’d go down to St. Mungo’s and kill Neville’s parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, so they could go on to their next great adventure, instead of letting them linger here in their damaged state— Harry barely, barely kept himself from saying it out loud. “All right,” Harry said coldly. “I’ll answer your original question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster, that you really believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify the exis- tence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they knew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine destroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of the universe, which you would do anything to prevent from happening even once? Because that’s what Death really is—the annihilation of a soul!” The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. “I suppose I do understand now,” he said quietly. “Oh?” said Harry. “Understand what?” “Voldemort,” said the old wizard. “I understand him now at last. Be- cause to believe that the world is truly like that, you must believe there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at its core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give no reason. And if I could ask him, I suppose, his answer would be: why not?” 666 667 CH APTER 40 668 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE II 669 CH APTER 40 670 PRETE NDING TO BE WISE II 671 The two allied Generals stepped together over Longbottom’s body, their boots hitting the floor in almost perfect synchrony. Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a Slytherin boy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white around his wand, held upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall. The boy’s breathing was coming rapidly, but his face showed the same cold determination that lit the eyes of his general, Harry Potter, who was standing behind the Pris- matic Wall at the dead end of the corridor next to an open window, with his hands held mysteriously behind his back. The battle had been ridiculously difficult, for the enemy being out- numbered two-to-one. It should have been easy, Dragon Army and the Sunshine Regiment had melded together easily in practice sessions, they’d fought each other long enough to know each other very well indeed. Morale was high, both armies knowing that this time they weren’t just fighting to win for themselves, but fighting for a world free of traitors. De- spite the surprised protests of both generals, the soldiers of the combined army had insisted on calling themselves Dramione’s Sungon Argiment, and produced patches for their insignia of a smiling face wreathed in flames. But Harry’s soldiers had all blackened their own insignia—it didn’t look like paint, more like they’d burned that part of their uniforms—and they’d fought all through the upper levels of Hogwarts with a desperate fury. The cold rage that Draco sometimes saw in Harry had seemed to trickle down into his soldiers, and they’d fought like it hadn’t been play. And Harry had emptied out his entire bag of tricks, there’d been tiny metal balls (Granger had identified them as “ball bearings”) on floors and staircases, rendering them impassable until cleared, only Harry’s army had already practised coordinated Hover Charms and they could fly their own people right over the obstacles they’d made… You couldn’t bring devices into the game from outside, but you could Transfigure anything you wanted during the game, so long as it was safe. And that just wasn’t fair when you were fighting a boy raised by scientists, who knew about things like ball bearings and skateboards and bungee cords. And so it had come to this. The survivors of the allied forces had cornered the last remnants of Harry Potter’s army in a dead-end corridor. Weasley and Vincent had rushed Longbottom at the same time, mov- ing together like they’d practised for weeks instead of hours, and some- how Longbottom had managed to hex them both before falling himself. And now it was Draco and Hermione and Padma and Samuel and Harry, and by the looks of Samuel, his Prismatic Wall couldn’t last much longer. Draco had already levelled his wand at Harry, waiting for the Pris- matic Wall to fall of its own accord; there was no need to waste a Breaking Drill Hex before then. Padma levelled her own wand at Samuel, Granger levelled hers at Harry… Harry was still hiding his hands behind his back, instead of aiming his wand; and looking at them with a face that could have been carved out of ice. It might be a bluff. It probably wasn’t. There was a brief, tense silence. And then Harry spoke. “I’m the villain now,” the young boy said coldly, “and if you think vil- lains are this easy to finish off, you’d better think again. Beat me when I’m fighting seriously, and I’ll stay beaten; but lose, and we’ll be doing this all over again next time.” The boy brought his hands forward, and Draco saw that Harry was wearing strange gloves, with a peculiar greyish material on the fingertips, and buckles that strapped the gloves tightly to his wrists. Beside Draco, the Sunshine General gasped in horror; and Draco, without even asking why, fired a Breaking Drill Hex. Samuel staggered, he let out a scream as he staggered, but he held the Wall; and if Padma or Granger fired now, they would exhaust their own forces so badly that they might just lose. “Harry!” shouted Granger. “You can’t be serious!” Harry was already in motion. And as he swung out the open window, his cold voice said, “Follow if you dare.” 676 FRONTAL OV ERRIDE One might have thought it would feel safer to have ground under your feet again. But if that ground was a slanted roof tiled with rough slats, which had rather a lot more ice on it than the stone walls, and you were running across it at a high rate of speed… Then you would be sadly mistaken. “Luminos!” shouted Draco. “Luminos!” shouted Granger. “Luminos!” shouted Draco. “Luminos!” shouted Granger. The distant figure was dodging and scrambling as it ran, and not a single shot hit, but they were gaining. Until Granger slipped. It was inevitable, in retrospect, in real life you couldn’t actually run across icy slanted rooftops at a high rate of speed. And also inevitably, because it happened without the slightest thought, Draco spun and grabbed for Granger’s right arm, and he caught her, only she was already too far off balance, she was falling and pulling Draco with her, it all happened so quickly— There was a hard, painful impact, not just Draco’s weight hitting the rooftop but some of Granger’s weight too, and if she’d hit just a little bit closer to the edge they could have made it, but instead her body tipped again and her legs slipped off and her other hand grabbed frantically… And that was how Draco ended up holding onto Granger’s arm in a white grip, while her other hand clenched frantically at the edge of the rooftop and the toes of Draco’s shoes dug into the edge of a roof tile. “Hermione!” Harry’s voice shrieked distantly. “Draco,” whispered Granger’s voice, and Draco looked down. That might have been a mistake. There was a lot of air underneath her, nothing but air, they were on the edge of a rooftop that had jutted out from the main stone wall of Hogwarts. “He’s going to come and help me,” whispered the girl, “but first he’s going to Luminos both of us, there’s no way he wouldn’t. You have to let me go.” It should have been the easiest thing in the world. She was just a mudblood, just a mudblood, just a mudblood! She wouldn’t even be hurt! …Draco’s brain wasn’t listening to anything Draco was telling it right now. “Do it,” Hermione Granger whispered, her eyes blazing without a sin- gle trace of fear, “do it, Draco, do it, you can beat him yourself we have to win, Draco!” There was a sound of someone running and it was coming closer. Oh, be rational… The voice in Draco’s head sounded an awful lot like Harry Potter teach- ing lessons. …are you going to let your brain run your life? 678 Aftermath, 1 FRONTAL OV ERRIDE 679 CH APTER 41 Aftermath, 2 Hermione made sure she got to their usual classroom nice and early that evening, just so that she would be by herself, in a chair, peacefully reading a book, when Harry got there. If there was any way for a door to creak open apologetically, that was how the door was creaking open. “Um,” said Harry Potter’s voice. Hermione kept reading. “I’m, um, kinda sorry, I didn’t mean for you to actually fall off the roof or anything…” It had been quite an entertaining experience, in fact. “I, ah…I don’t have much experience apologizing, I’ll fall to my knees if you want, or buy you something expensive, Hermione I don’t know how to apologize to you for this what can I do just tell me?” She kept reading the book in silence. It wasn’t as if she had any idea how Harry could apologize, either. Right now she was just feeling a sort of odd curiosity as to what would happen if she kept reading her book for a while. CHAPTER FORT Y-TWO COURAG E “Romantic?” Hermione said. “They’re both boys!” “Wow,” Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. “You mean Muggles really do hate that? I thought that was just something the Death Eaters made up.” “No,” said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn’t recognize, “it’s true, they have to get married in secret, and if they’re ever discovered, they get burned at the stake together. And if you’re a girl who thinks it’s romantic, they burn you too.” “That can’t be right!” objected a Gryffindor girl, while Hermione was still trying to sort out what to say to that. “There wouldn’t be any Muggle girls left!” She’d kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on trying to apologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry had realized, possibly for the first time in his life, that he’d done something annoying; and that Harry, definitely for the first time in his life, was terrified that he’d lost her as a friend; and she’d started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worried about the direction Harry’s increasingly desperate offers were going. But she still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so she’d said that the Ravenclaw girls should vote on it—and this time she wouldn’t fix the outcome, though she hadn’t mentioned that part—to which Harry had instantly agreed. The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of thirteen had voted to have Draco drop Harry. Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though it was obviously fair. Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the castle amid half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was beginning to suspect that there were things going on here that she did not under- stand and that she desperately hoped neither of her fellow generals ever heard about. 682 COURAG E Harry’s other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified grip, his fin- gers white on the cold, cold stone. You could know with your conscious mind that you’d drunk the Feather-Falling Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind was another matter entirely. It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have been for Hermione, which was justice. “Draco,” said Harry, controlling his voice wasn’t easy, but the Raven- claw girls had given them a script, “You’ve got to let me go!” “Okay!” said Draco, and let go of Harry’s arm. Harry’s other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any deci- sion being made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell. There was a brief moment when Harry’s stomach tried to leap up into his throat, and his body tried desperately to orient itself in the absence of any possible way to do so. There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the Feather-Falling Potion kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of lurching, cushioning feel- ing. And then something pulled on Harry and he accelerated downward again faster than gravity— Harry’s mouth had already opened and begun screaming while part of his brain tried to think of something creative he could do, part of his brain tried to calculate how much time he had left to be creative, and a tiny rump part of his brain noticed that he wasn’t even going to finish the remaining-time calculation before he hit the ground— 683 CH APTER 42 684 COURAG E Mr Lupin’s temporary office was a small stone room with a small wooden desk, and Harry couldn’t see anything of what Mr Lupin was sitting on, suggesting that it was a small stool just like the one in front of his desk. Harry guessed that Mr Lupin wouldn’t be at Hogwarts for long, or use this office much, and so he’d told the house elves not to waste the effort. It said something about a person that he tried not to bother house elves. Specifically, it said that he’d been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of Harry’s knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried about bothering house elves. (Harry himself thought her qualms rather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the first place had been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn’t mean Hermione was doing the right thing now by denying sentient beings the drudgery they had been shaped to enjoy.) “Please sit down, Harry,” the man said quietly. His formal robes were of low quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the passage of time in a way that simple Repair Charms couldn’t fix; shabby was the word that came to mind. And despite that, somehow, there was a dignity about him that couldn’t have been obtained by fine and expensive robes, that wouldn’t have fit with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of the shabby. Harry had heard of humility, but he’d never seen the real thing before—only the satisfied modesty of people who thought it was part of their style and wanted you to notice. Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr Lupin’s short desk. “Thank you for coming,” the man said. “No, thank you for saving me,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever need something impossible done.” The man seemed to hesitate. “Harry, may I…ask a personal question?” “You can ask, certainly,” Harry said. “I have a lot of questions for you, too.” Mr Lupin nodded. “Harry, are your step-parents treating you well?” “My parents,” Harry said. “I have four. Michael, James, Petunia, and Lily.” “Ah,” said Mr Lupin. And then, “Ah” again. He seemed to be blinking rather hard. “I…that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore would tell none of us where you were…I was afraid he might think you ought to have wicked step-parents, or some such…” Harry wasn’t sure Mr Lupin’s concern had been misplaced, consider- ing his own first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all turned out well enough, so he said nothing. “What about my…” Harry searched for a word that didn’t raise them higher or put them lower…“other parents? I want to know, well, everything.” “A tall order,” Mr Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his forehead. “Well, let us begin at the beginning. When you were born, James was so happy that he couldn’t touch his wand without it glowing gold, for a whole week. And even after that, whenever he held you, or saw Lily holding you, or just thought of you, it would happen again—” 687 CH APTER 42 “No, Harry,” said Remus. “I don’t know why Black went after Peter in- stead of running. It was as though Black was making tragedy for the sake of tragedy that day.” The man’s voice was unsteady. “There was no hint, no warning, we all thought—to think that he was to be—” Remus’s voice cut off. Harry was crying, he couldn’t help it, it hurt worse to hear it from Re- mus than anything he’d ever felt himself. Harry had lost two parents he didn’t remember, knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had lost all four of his best friends in less than twenty-four hours; and for the loss of his last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew, there’d just been no reason at all. “Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban,” Remus finished, his voice almost a whisper. “I am glad, Harry, that Death Eaters are not allowed visitors. It means I do not have to feel ashamed of not going.” Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak. “Can you tell me about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father’s friend, and it seems—that I should know, that I should remember—” Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. “I think, Harry, that if Peter had known it would end that way—” the man’s voice choked up. “Peter was more afraid of the Dark Lord than any of us, and if he’d known it would end that way, I don’t think he would have done it. But Peter knew the risk, Harry, he knew the risk was real, that it could happen, and yet he stayed by James and Lily’s side. All through Hogwarts I used to wonder why Peter hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe Ravenclaw, because Peter so adored secrets, he couldn’t resist them, he would find out things about people, things they wanted kept hidden—” A brief wry look crossed Remus’s face. “But he didn’t use those secrets, Harry. He just wanted to know. And then the Dark Lord’s shadow fell over everything, and Peter stood by James and Lily and put his talents to good use, and I understood why the Hat had sent him to Gryffindor.” Remus’s voice was fierce now, and proud. “It’s easy to stand by your friends if you’re a hero like Godric, bold and strong like people think Gryffindors should be. But if Peter was more afraid than any of us, doesn’t that also make him the most brave?” “It does,” Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he almost couldn’t talk. “If you could, Mr Lupin, if you have time, there’s someone else who I think should hear Peter Pettigrew’s story, a student in first-year Hufflepuff, named Neville Longbottom.” “Alice and Frank’s boy,” said Remus, his voice turning sad. “I see. It is not a happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if you think it will help him.” Harry nodded. A brief silence fell. “Did Black have any unfinished business with Peter Pettigrew?” Harry said. “Anything that would make him seek out Mr Pettigrew, even if it wasn’t a killing matter? Like a secret Mr Pettigrew knew, that Black wanted to know himself, or wanted to kill him to hide?” Something flickered in Remus’s eyes, but the older man shook his head, and said, “Not really.” “That means there is something,” said Harry. That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper mous- tache. “You have a bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it’s not important, Harry.” “I’m a Ravenclaw, I’m not supposed to resist the temptation of secrets. And,” Harry said more seriously, “if it was worth Black getting caught, I can’t help but think it might matter.” Remus looked quite uncomfortable. “I suppose I could tell you when you’re older, but really, Harry, it’s not important! Just something from our school days.” Harry couldn’t have put his finger on exactly what tipped him off; it might have been something about the exact tone of nervousness in Re- mus’s voice, or the way the man had said when you’re older, that sparked the sudden leap of Harry’s intuition… “Actually,” said Harry, “I think I’ve sort of guessed it already, sorry.” Remus raised his eyebrows. “Have you?” He sounded a bit skeptical. “They were lovers, weren’t they?” There was an awkward pause. Remus gave a slow, grave nod. “Once,” Remus said. “A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in vast tragedy, or so it seemed to us all when we were young.” The unhappy puzzlement was plain on his face. “But I had thought that long since over and done and buried beneath adult friendship, until the day that Black killed Peter.” CHAPTER FORT Y-THREE HUMANISM, PART I The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside Hogwarts. For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had been let out of class. The first-years who’d signed up for it were practising a certain spell, a spell that was most advantageously learned outdoors, be- neath the bright sun and a clear blue sky, rather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies and lemonade were also considered helpful. The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you twitched your wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small tilts at exactly the right relative angles, you shifted your forefinger and thumb exactly the right distances… The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach any- one the spell before their fifth year. There had been a few known cases of younger children learning it, and this had been dismissed as “genius”. It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but Harry was be- ginning to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that the Ministry Com- mittee of Curriculum would have been of greater benefit to wizardkind if they had been used as landfill. So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn’t stop you from learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be extra care- ful and practise each part for a lot longer than usual, that was all. Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were like that because they required more strength of magic than any young stu- dent could muster. But the Patronus Charm wasn’t like that, it wasn’t dif- ficult because it needed too much magic, it was difficult because it took more than mere magic. It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your heart, the loving memories, a different kind of strength that you didn’t need for or- dinary spells. Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times, shifted his fingers exactly the right distances… “Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you enough books?” “You can never have enough books…but you certainly tried, it was a really, re- ally, really good try…” It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had remembered and tried to put it into the spell. Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a gesture that didn’t have to be precise, only bold and defiant. “Expecto Patronum!” cried Harry. Nothing happened. Not a single flicker of light. When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a rather troubled look on his faintly scarred face. Finally Remus shook his head. “I’m sorry, Harry,” the man said quietly. “Your wandwork was exactly right.” And there wasn’t a flicker of light anywhere else, either, because all the other first-years who were supposed to be practising their Patronus Charms had been glancing out of the corners of their eyes at Harry in- stead. The tears were threatening to come back into Harry’s eyes, and they weren’t happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things, Harry had never expected this. There was something horribly humiliating about being informed that you weren’t happy enough. What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn’t, that made Anthony’s wand shine with that bright light? Did Anthony love his own father more? “What thought were you using to cast it?” said Remus. “My father,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I asked him to buy me some books before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they were expen- sive, and then he asked me if they were enough—” Harry didn’t try to explain about the Verres family motto. “Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry,” said Remus. He gestured toward where some other students were sitting on the ground, looking disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. “You won’t be able to cast a Patronus Charm while you’re feeling ashamed of not being grateful enough.” There was a gentle compassion in Mr Lupin’s voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like hitting something. Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other failures were sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also been pro- claimed perfect, and who were now supposed to be searching for happier thoughts; by the looks of them they weren’t making much progress. There were many robes there trimmed in dark blue, and a handful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying. The Slytherins hadn’t even bothered showing up, except for Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the gestures. Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the stu- dent whose failure had surprised him the most. “So you couldn’t do it either,” Hermione said. She’d fled the field at first, but she’d come back after that, and you had to look closely at her reddened eyes to see that she’d been crying. “I,” Harry said, “I, I’d probably feel a lot worse about that if you hadn’t failed, you’re the nicest, person I know, that I’ve ever met, Hermione, and if you also can’t do it, it means I might still be, be good…” “I should have gone to Gryffindor,” Hermione whispered. She blinked hard a few times, but she didn’t wipe her eyes. 693 CH APTER 43 694 HUMANISM I 695 CH APTER 43 696 HUMANISM I Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the stu- dents milling about on the withered and snow-spotted grass. Seamus’s Patronus Charm had been successful, but there was still that interval between when the Headmaster dispelled his own Patronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when you faced the Dementor’s fear unshielded. Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly safe, even for an eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a still-maturing brain. There was a lot of variance in how hard the Dementor’s power hit people, which was another thing not quite understood; but twenty sec- onds was definitely safe. Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might possibly have been enough to cause permanent damage, though only to the most sensi- tive subjects. It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where the way you learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on one and told to get going. Harry was no fan of over-protectiveness, and if you looked at the difference in maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was clear that Muggles were smothering their children…but even Harry had started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not every hurt could be healed afterwards. But if you couldn’t cast the spell under those conditions, it meant you couldn’t rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend yourself; overconfi- dence was even more dangerous to wizards than to Muggles. Dementors could drain your magic and your physical vitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you might not be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if you didn’t recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was within range for its attack. (During his reading, Harry had discovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the Demen- tor’s Kiss would eat your soul and that this was the reason for the perma- nent mindless coma into which it put the victims. And that wizards who believed this had deliberately used the Dementor’s Kiss to execute criminals. It was a certainty that some called criminals were innocent, and even if they weren’t, destroying their souls? If Harry had believed in souls, he would have…drawn a blank, he just couldn’t think of an appropriate response to that.) The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the three Aurors standing guard. Their leader was an Asian-looking man, solemn without being grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left his hand. His Patronus, an orang-utan of solid moonlight, paced back and forth between the Dementor and the first-years awaiting their turn; beside the orang-utan moved the bright white panther of Auror Butnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail, and a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two Patronuses, were all watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of the students was the resting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale and unshaven, sitting back on a chair he’d conjured without word or wand, and maintaining an absent- minded poker face as he scanned the entire scene. Professor Quirrell had shown up not long after the first-years began their attempts, and his eyes never strayed far from Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a champion duellist, was fiddling absently with his wand; and his eyes, peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served as his face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell. And it must have been Harry’s imagination, but Professor Quirrell seemed to wince slightly each time the Headmaster’s Patronus winked out to test the next student. Maybe Professor Quirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as Harry, that backwash of emptiness caressing at his mind. “Anthony Goldstein,” called the voice of the Headmaster. Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to ap- proach the shining silver phœnix, and…whatever it was beneath the tat- tered cloak. “What did you see?” Harry asked Seamus in a low voice. A lot of students hadn’t answered Harry, when he’d tried to gather the data; but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry’s lieutenants. Maybe that wasn’t fair, but… “Dead,” said Seamus in a whisper, “greyish and slimy…dead and left in water for a while…” Harry nodded. “That’s what a lot of people see,” Harry said. He pro- jected confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus needed it. “Go eat some chocolate, you’ll feel better.” Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing sweets. “Expecto Patronum!” cried a young boy’s voice. Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors. Harry spun around to look— There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony Goldstein and the cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry, and the cry was also silver, as bright and hard and beautiful as metal. And something in the back of Harry’s mind said, if that’s a peregrine falcon, I’m going to strangle him in his sleep. Shut up, Harry said to the thought, do you want us to be a Dark Wizard? What’s the point? You’re going to end up as one eventually. That…wasn’t something Harry would usually have thought… It’s a placebo effect, Harry told himself again. The Dementor can’t actually get to me through three corporeal Patronuses, I’m just imagining what I think it’s like. When I actually face the Dementor, it’ll feel completely different, and then I’ll know I was just being silly before. A slight chill went down Harry’s spine then, because he had a feeling that yes, it would be completely different, and not in a positive direction. The blazing silver phœnix sprang back into existence from the Head- master’s wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein began to walk back. The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out the next name, the Patronus waiting behind to guard the Dementor. Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind the glowing panther. Hermione’s turn would have come next, but had appar- ently just been delayed. She looked stressed. Earlier, she’d politely asked Harry to please stop trying to de-stress her. Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back toward the others; smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster looked very, very tired. “Unbelievable,” said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much weaker than his accustomed boom. “A corporeal Patronus, in his first year. And an astounding number of successes among the other young students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge that you have proved your point.” Professor Quirrell inclined his head. “A simple enough guess, I should think. A Dementor attacks through fear, and children are less afraid.” “Less afraid?” said Auror Goryanof from where he was sitting. “So I said as well,” said Dumbledore. “And Professor Quirrell pointed out that adults had more courage, not less to fear; which thought, I con- fess, had never occurred to me before.” “That was not my precise phrasing,” Professor Quirrell said dryly, “but it will do. And the rest of our agreement, Headmaster?” “As you say,” Dumbledore said reluctantly. “I admit I was not expecting to lose that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your wisdom.” All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione, who was staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying robes; and Harry, who was watching everyone, since he was imagining himself feel- ing paranoid. Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further comments, “I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who wish to learn it. Which will render them considerably safer from Dark Wizards and other pests, and it is foolish to think they will otherwise know no deadly magics.” Professor Quirrell paused, his eyes narrowing. “Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are not looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day’s task to Professor Flitwick.” Dumbledore shook his head. “We are almost done for the day, Quiri- nus. I will last.” Hermione had approached Anthony. “Captain Goldstein,” she said, and her voice trembled only a little, “can you give me any advice?” “Don’t be afraid,” Anthony said firmly. “Don’t think about anything it tries to make you think about. You’re not just holding up the wand in front of you as a shield against the fear, you’re brandishing your wand to drive the fear away, that’s how you make a happy thought into something solid…” Anthony shrugged helplessly. “I mean, I heard all that before, but…” Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with their own questions. “Miss Granger?” the Headmaster said. His voice might have been gen- tle, or just weakened. Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him. “What did you see under the cloak?” Harry said to Anthony. Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, “A very tall man who was dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and dead-coloured…it hurt to see him and I knew that was the Dementor trying to get at me.” Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage and the cloak. Hermione raised her wand into position for the first gestures. The Headmaster’s phœnix winked out of existence. And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched— —took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then she brandished it and said “Expecto Patronum!” Nothing happened. Hermione turned and ran. “Expecto Patronum!” said the Headmaster’s deeper voice, and the silver phœnix blazed back to life. The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds beginning to come from her throat. “Hermione!” Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne, and Ernie, and they all started to run toward her; even as Harry, who was always think- ing one step ahead, spun on his own heel and ran for the table with the chocolate. Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione’s mouth and she’d chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great gasps and crying, her eyes still seemed unfocused. She can’t have been permanently Demented, Harry thought desperately at the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and deathly fury beginning to twist around each other, she can’t have been, she wasn’t exposed for even ten seconds let alone forty— But she could be temporarily Demented, as Harry realized in that mo- ment, there wasn’t any rule that you couldn’t be temporarily injured by a Dementor in just ten seconds if you were sensitive enough. Then Hermione’s eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and settle on him. “Harry,” she gasped, and the other students went silent. “Harry, don’t. Don’t!” Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn’t do, was he in her worst memories, or some sleep’s nightmare that she was now reliving in waking life? “Don’t go near it!” said Hermione. Her hand reached out, grabbed him by the lapel of his robes. “You mustn’t go near it, Harry! It spoke to me, Harry, it knows you, it knows you’re here!” “What—” Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking. “The Dementor!” said Hermione. Her voice rose to a shriek. “Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!” In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps; but he didn’t approach any closer (Harry was there, after all). “Miss Granger,” he said, and his voice was grave, “I think you should have some more chocolate.” “Professor Flitwick, don’t let Harry try, send him back!” The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor Flitwick were exchanging worried looks. “I did not hear the Dementor speak,” the Headmaster said. “Still…” “Just ask,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little weary. “Did the Dementor say how it would get to Harry?” said the Headmas- ter. “All his tastiest parts first,” said Hermione, “it would—it would eat—” Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her eyes. Then she started crying. “You were too brave, Hermione Granger,” the Headmaster said. His voice was gentle, and clearly audible. “Too much braver than I com- prehended. You should have turned and run, not endured and tried to complete your Charm. When you are older and stronger, Miss Granger, I know that you will try again, and I know that you will succeed.” “I’m sorry,” Hermione said in gasps, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry… I’m sorry, Harry, I can’t tell you what I saw, I didn’t look at it, I didn’t dare look at it, I knew it was too horrible to ever be seen…” It should have been Harry, but he’d hesitated, because his hands were all chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping Hermione from where she’d fallen on the grass, leading her toward the snacks table. Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right again, and she went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but she was al- ways watching Harry, every time that he glanced in her direction. He’d stepped toward her only once, and stopped when she’d stepped away. Her eyes had silently apologized, and silently pleaded for him to leave her be. 703 CH APTER 43 Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, “Ouch,” and Dumble- dore had recast his Patronus right away. Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a tiger, larger than Dumbledore’s phœnix, though not nearly as bright. There had been a great burst of applause from all the watchers, though not the same shock as when Anthony had done it. And then it was Harry’s turn. The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was afraid. Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that it was going to hurt. But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a Demen- tor, a wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus, and no-one understood why. And because if Harry couldn’t defend himself from Dementors, he had to be able to recognize their approach, recognize the feeling of them in his mind, and run before it was too late. What is my worst memory…? Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or a hopeful look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore only watched him with quiet calm. He thinks I’m going to fail, but he won’t sabotage me by telling me so, thought Harry, if he had true words of encouragement to speak, he would speak them… The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted away to nothing, not yet. The cloak came closer. It was unravelling and shot through with un- patched holes; it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had said. “Headmaster?” Harry said. “What do you see?” The Headmaster’s voice was also calm. “The Dementors are creatures of fear, and as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so does the fear- someness of its form. I see a tall, thin, naked man. He is not decaying. He is only slightly painful to look upon. That is all. What do you see, Harry?” …Harry couldn’t see under the cloak. Or that wasn’t right, it was that his mind was refusing to see what was under the cloak… No, his mind was trying to see the wrong thing under the cloak, Harry could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But Harry had done his best to train himself to notice that tiny feeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start inventing a lie about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to shut it down. Harry looked under the cloak and saw… An open question. Harry wouldn’t let his mind see something false, and so he didn’t see anything, like the part of his visual cortex getting that signal was just ceasing to exist. There was a blind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn’t know what was under there. Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy. The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but the blazing bird of moonlight, the white phœnix, yet lay between them. Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had. Half the ones who’d had no luck with their Patronus Charms just hadn’t shown up today in the first place. Of those remaining, half had fled before the Headmaster had even dispelled his own Patronus, and no-one had said a word. There’d been a little laughter when Terry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan and Hannah, who’d gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up. But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect if he was seen to give up without even trying… Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the presence of whatever lay beneath the cloak. Why am I still here? It wasn’t the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept Harry’s feet in place. It wasn’t the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up his wand. It wasn’t the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that moved his fingers into the initial position. It was something else, something that had to oppose whatever lay be- neath the cloak, this was the true darkness and Harry had to find out whether it lay within him, the power to drive it back. Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his book-shopping spree with his father, but instead, at the last minute, facing the Dementor, a different memory occurred to him, something he hadn’t tried before; a thought that wasn’t warm and happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow. And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly bright and unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill him, fill all of him like an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind, became once again the bodiless awareness of the void. The bright silver shining phœnix vanished. And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God. FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when the peaceful starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as Harry’s fin- gers began the wand motions, practised until they had become automatic. They weren’t warm and happy, those blazing points of light in perfect blackness; but it was an image the Dementor could not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast and unafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural state. But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable object trying to resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a twinge of anger at the Dementor for trying to feed on him, and it was like slipping on wet ice. Harry’s mind began to slide sideways, into bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred— Harry’s wand came up in the final brandish. It felt wrong. “Expecto Patronum,” his voice spoke, the words hollow and pointless. And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side, further and faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as the slide accelerated, as the Dementor latched onto the exposed and vulnerable parts and fed on them, eating away the light. A fading reflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an image of Hermione came to him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted it, showed him Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother and father, and then even that was sucked away. Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something for- gotten so long ago that the neural patterns shouldn’t have still existed. “Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him!” shouted a man’s voice. “Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!” And Harry couldn’t help but think, in the empty depths of his dark side, how ridiculously overconfident James Potter had been. Hold off Lord Voldemort? With what? Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a kettle, and it was like dry ice laid on Harry’s every nerve, like a brand of metal cooled to liquid helium temperatures and laid on every part of him. And the voice said: “Avada Kedavra.” (The wand flew from the boy’s nerveless fingers as his body began to convulse and fall, the Headmaster’s eyes widening in alarm as he began his own Patronus Charm.) “Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” screamed the woman’s voice. Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light drained out of him, in the dead void of his heart, and wondered if she thought that Lord Voldemort would stop because she asked politely. “Step aside, woman!” said the shrill voice of burning cold. “For you I am not come, only the boy.” “Not Harry! Please…have mercy…have mercy…” Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what type of people be- came Dark Lords in the first place; and if this was the best strategy she could con- ceive to save her child’s life, that was her final failure as a mother. “I give you this rare chance to flee,” said the shrill voice. “But I will not trou- ble myself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your child. Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all!” “Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!” The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter seriously imagined that Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and then depart leaving her son un- harmed. “Very well,” said the voice of death, now sounding coldly amused, “I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.” There was a hideous silence. Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous laughter. And then, at last, Lily Potter’s voice shrieked in desperate hate, “Avada Ke—” The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and precise. “Avada Kedavra.” A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily Potter. And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson eyes, seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns, filling Harry’s whole vision as they locked to his own— 709 CH APTER 43 710 HUMANISM I The eyes opened, dead and vacant. “Harry!” gasped a voice in the colourless world. “Harry! Speak to me!” The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of vision, which had been occupied by a distant marble ceiling. “You’re annoying,” said the empty voice. “You should die.” CHAPTER FORT Y-FOUR HUMANISM, PART II “Fawkes,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, “help him, please—” A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of vision, looking down quizzically; and it began to croon. The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing onto which they could hold. “You’re noisy,” said the voice, “you should die.” “Chocolate,” Albus Dumbledore said, “you need chocolate, and your friends—but I dare not take you back—” Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick’s voice; whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, and cursed aloud at his own stupidity. The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to be amused. And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire. 713 CH APTER 44 714 HUMANISM II 715 CH APTER 44 There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The response to compulsion was killing. People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The re- sponse to annoyance was killing. Other people were chattering in the background. That was insolent. The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them were useful, killing them would be simpler. Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them didn’t trust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right trigger could cause them all to kill each other. Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did some- thing completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode of thought, for which there was only a single response stored anywhere— “I think he’ll be all right now,” the Headmaster said, looking at where Harry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned over him. “Ex- cellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I would have ex- pected that to actually work?” The phœnix’s song wasn’t meant for her, Hermione knew, but she could still be soothed by it, which she needed, because her life was officially over. CHAPTER FORT Y-FI V E HUMANISM, PART III Fawkes’s song gently trailed off into nothing. Harry sat up from where he had lain on the winter-blasted grass, Fawkes still perched on his shoulder. There were intakes of breath from all around him. “Harry,” said Seamus in a wavering voice, “are you all right?” The peace of the phœnix was still in him, and warmth, from where Fawkes perched. Warmth, spreading out through him, and the memory of the song, still alive in the phœnix’s presence. There were terrible things that had happened to him, terrible thoughts that had passed through him. He had regained an impossible memory, for all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A strange word kept echoing in his mind. And all of that could be put on hold for later, while the phœnix still shone red and gold beneath the setting sun. Fawkes cawed at him. “Something I have to do?” Harry said to Fawkes. “What?” Fawkes bobbed its head in the direction of the Dementor. Harry looked at the unseeable horror still in its cage, then back at the phœnix, puzzled. “Mr Potter?” said Minerva McGonagall’s voice from behind him. “Are you all right?” Harry climbed to his feet and turned. Minerva McGonagall was looking at him, looking very worried; Al- bus Dumbledore beside her was studying him carefully; Filius Flitwick appeared tremendously relieved; and all the students were just plain staring. “I think so, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said calmly. He’d almost said Minerva before managing to stop himself. While Fawkes was on his shoulder, at least, Harry was fine; it might be that he would collapse a moment after Fawkes left, but somehow thoughts like that didn’t seem important. “I think I’m okay.” There ought to have been cheering, or sighs of relief, or something, but no-one seemed to know what to say, no-one at all. The peace of the phœnix lingered. Harry turned back. “Hermione?” he said. Everyone with the tiniest smidgen of romance in their hearts held their breath. “I don’t really know how to say thank you graciously,” Harry said qui- etly, “any more than I know how to apologize. All I can say that if you’re wondering whether it was the right thing to do, it was.” The boy and the girl gazed into each other’s eyes. “Sorry,” Harry said. “About what happens next. If there’s anything I can do—” “No,” Hermione said back. “There isn’t. It’s all right, though.” Then she turned from Harry and walked away, toward the path that led back to the gates of Hogwarts. A number of girls gave Harry puzzled looks, and then followed her. As they went, you could hear the excited questions starting. Harry looked at them as they left, turned back to look at the other stu- dents. They’d seen him on the ground, screaming, and… Fawkes nuzzled his cheek, briefly. …and that would help them, some day, understanding that the Boy- Who-Lived could also be hurt, could be wretched. So that when they were hurt and wretched themselves, they would remember seeing Harry writhing on the ground, and know that their own pain and troubles didn’t mean they’d never amount to anything. Had the Headmaster calculated that, when he had let the other students stay and watch? Harry’s eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost absent- mindedly, and without really being aware of what he was speaking, Harry said, “It shouldn’t exist.” “Ah,” said a dry, precise voice. “I thought you might say that. I am very sorry to tell you, Mr Potter, that Dementors cannot be killed. Many have tried.” “Really?” Harry said, still absent-mindedly. “What did they try?” “There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,” Profes- sor Quirrell said, “which I will not name here; a spell of cursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors. They are undying.” “They are not undying,” said the Headmaster. The words mild, the gaze sharp. “They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger.” “Hm,” Harry said. “Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it be destroyed?” “Throw it into the Sun?” squeaked Professor Flitwick, looking like he wanted to faint. “It seems unlikely, Mr Potter,” Professor Quirrell said dryly. “The Sun is very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have much effect on it. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr Potter, just in case.” “I see,” Harry said. Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry’s head, and then launched himself from Harry. Launched himself straight to- ward the Dementor, screaming a great piercing cry of defiance that echoed around the field. And before anyone could react to that, there was a flash of fire, and Fawkes was gone. The peace faded, a little. The warmth faded, a little. Harry took in a deep breath, let it out again. “Yep,” Harry said. “Still alive.” Again that silence, again the absence of cheering; no-one seemed to know how to respond— “It is good to know you are fully recovered, Mr Potter,” Professor Quir- rell said firmly, as though to deny any other possibility. “Now, I believe Miss Ransom was up next?” That started a bit of an argument, in which Professor Quirrell was right and everyone else was wrong. The Defence Professor pointed out that, despite the understandable emotions of all concerned, the chance of a similar mishap occurring to any other student verged on the infinitesi- mal; the more so as they now knew to avoid mischances with wands. And meanwhile, there were other students who needed to take their own best chance at casting a corporeal Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling of a Dementor so they could flee, and discover their own degree of vulnera- bility… In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of Gryf- findor were the only ones left who were still willing to go anywhere near the Dementor, which simplified the argument. Harry glanced in the Dementor’s direction. The word echoed in his mind again. All right, Harry thought to himself, if the Dementor is a riddle, what is the answer? And just like that, it was obvious. Harry looked at the tarnished, slightly corroded cage. He saw what lay beneath the tall, tattered cloak. That was it, then. Professor McGonagall came and spoke to Harry. She hadn’t seen the worst of it, so there was only a slight glitter of water in her eyes. Harry told her that he needed to talk to her afterwards and ask a question he’d put off for a while, but that didn’t need to happen right now, if she was busy. There was a certain look about her which suggested that she had been pulled away from something important; and Harry observed this to her, and said that she honestly didn’t need to feel guilty about leaving. This earned him something of a sharp look, but then leave she did, hurriedly, with a promise that they would talk later. Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor’s presence; and Ron Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling mist. Which concluded the day, so far as everyone else was concerned, and Professor Flitwick began to herd the students back to Hogwarts. When it was clear that Harry meant to stay behind, Professor Flitwick looked at him quizzically; and Harry, for his part, glanced significantly at Dumble- dore. Harry didn’t know what Professor Flitwick made of that, but after a sharp gaze of warning, his Head of House departed. And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster Dum- bledore, and an Auror trio. It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but Harry couldn’t think of a good way to do that. “All right,” said Auror Komodo, “let’s take it back.” “Excuse me,” Harry said. “I’d like to have another go at the Dementor.” 723 CH APTER 45 724 HUMANISM III 725 CH APTER 45 726 HUMANISM III 727 CH APTER 45 728 HUMANISM III 729 731 CH APTER 46 732 HUMANISM I V Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all back- ground noise dropped into silence when he did. “You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student,” said Profes- sor Quirrell. “Thank you,” Harry said sincerely. “I am not prying,” said Professor Quirrell, “but on the off-chance that it was only the Headmaster who you did not trust with the secret…?” Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already couldn’t cast the an- imal Patronus Charm. But you couldn’t untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough learner to realize that he ought to at least think for a while before unleashing this one upon the world. Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded acceptance. “Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell,” said Harry, “if your bringing the Dementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot, what would have been its goal?” “Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened,” Professor Quirrell said without even hesitating. “Hm. The Headmaster told you he was sus- picious of me?” Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a reply, and then gave up when he realized he’d already answered. “Interesting…” Professor Quirrell said. “Mr Potter, it is not out of the question that there was a plot at work today. Your wand ending up that close to the Dementor’s cage could have been an accident. Or one of the Aurors could have been Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized to exert an influence. Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects, in your calculation. One notes that Professor Snape cancelled all his classes today, and I suspect he is powerful enough to Disillusion himself; the Au- rors cast detection charms early on, but they did not repeat them imme- diately before your turn. But most easily of all, Mr Potter, the deed could have been plotted by Dumbledore himself; and if he did, why, he might also take steps in advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere.” They walked on for a few steps. “But why would he?” Harry said. The Defence Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said, “Mr Pot- ter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster’s character?” “Not many,” said Harry. He’d only recently realized…“Not nearly enough.” “Then I will observe,” said Professor Quirrell, “that you do not find out all there is to know about a man by asking only his friends.” Now it was Harry’s turn to walk a few steps in silence on the little used dirt path that led back to Hogwarts. He’d really been supposed to know better than that already. Confirmation bias was the technical term; it meant, among other things, that when you chose your information sources, there was a notable tendency to choose information sources that agreed with your current opinions. “Thank you,” Harry said. “Actually…I didn’t say it earlier, did I? Thank you for everything. If another Dementor ever threatens you, or for that matter, slightly annoys you, just let me know and I’ll introduce it to Mister Glowy Person. I don’t like it when Dementors slightly annoy my friends.” That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell. “You destroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?” “Erm,” Harry said, “I’d sort of decided on it before then, but yes, that would have been sufficient reason by itself.” “I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “And what would you have done about the threat to me if your spell hadn’t worked for destroying the Dementor?” “Plan B,” said Harry. “Encase the Dementor in dense metal with a high melting point, probably tungsten, drop it into an active volcano, and hope it ends up inside Earth’s mantle. Ah, the whole planet is filled with molten lava under its surface—” “Yes,” said Professor Quirrell. “I know.” The Defence Professor was wearing a very odd smile. “I really should have thought of that myself, all things considered. Tell me, Mr Potter, if you wanted to lose something where no-one would ever find it again, where would you put it?” Harry considered this question. “I suppose I shouldn’t ask what you’ve found that needs losing—” “Quite,” said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and then, “Per- haps you will be told when you are older,” which Harry hadn’t. “Well,” said Harry, “besides trying to get it into the molten core of the planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometre underground in a randomly selected location—maybe teleport it in, if there’s some way to do that blindly, or drill a hole and repair the hole afterwards; the im- portant thing would be not to leave any traces leading there, so it’s just an anonymous cubic metre somewhere in the Earth’s crust. You could drop it into the Mariana Trench, that’s the deepest depth of ocean on the planet—or just pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less ob- vious. If you could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throw it into the stratosphere. Or ideally you would launch it into space, with a cloak against detection, and a randomly fluctuating acceleration fac- tor that would take it out of the Solar System. And afterwards, of course, you’d Obliviate yourself, so even you didn’t know exactly where it was.” The Defence Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder than his smile. “Professor Quirrell?” Harry said. “All excellent suggestions,” said Professor Quirrell. “But tell me, Mr Potter, why those exact five?” “Huh?” said Harry. “They just seemed like the obvious sorts of ideas.” “Oh?” said Professor Quirrell. “But there is an interesting pattern to them, you see. One might say it sounds like something of a riddle. I must admit, Mr Potter, that although it has had its ups and downs, on the whole, this has been a surprisingly good day.” And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates of Hog- warts, quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even thinking about it, automatically stayed far enough away from the Defence Professor not to trigger that sense of doom, which for some reason seemed unusually strong right now. 736 HUMANISM I V 737 CH APTER 46 Aftermath, Hermione Granger Hermione stared at the wax-sealed paper, on the surface of which was inscribed simply the number 42. I figured out why we couldn’t cast the Patronus Charm, Hermione, it doesn’t have anything to do with us not being happy enough. But I can’t tell you. I couldn’t even tell the Headmaster. It needs to be even more secret than partial Transfigura- tion, for now, anyway. But if you ever need to fight Dementors, the secret is written here, cryptically, so that if someone doesn’t know it’s about Dementors and the Pa- tronus Charm, they won’t know what it means… She’d told Harry about seeing him dying, her parents dying, all her friends dying, everyone dying. She hadn’t told him about her terror of dying alone, somehow that was still too painful. Harry had told her about remembering his parents dying, and that he’d thought it was funny. There’s no light in the place the Dementor takes you, Hermione. No warmth. No caring. It’s somewhere that you can’t even understand happiness. There’s pain, and fear, and those can still drive you. You can hate, and take pleasure in destroy- ing what you hate. You can laugh, when you see other people hurting. But you can’t ever be happy, you can’t even remember what it is that isn’t there any more…I don’t think there’s any way I can ever explain just what you saved me from. I’m usually ashamed to put people to trouble, I usually can’t stand it when people make sacri- fices for me, but this one time I’ll say that no matter what it ends up costing you to have kissed me, don’t ever doubt for a second that it was the right thing to do. Hermione hadn’t realized how little the Dementor had touched her, how small and shallow had been the darkness into which it had taken her. She’d seen everyone dying, and that had still been able to hurt. Hermione put the paper back into her pouch, like a good girl ought to. She’d really wanted to read it, though. She was frightened of Dementors. 739 CH APTER 46 740 HUMANISM I V 741 CH APTER 46 742 HUMANISM I V 743 745 CH APTER 47 746 PERSONHOOD THEORY 747 CH APTER 47 748 PERSONHOOD THEORY 749 CH APTER 47 Harry watched closely as Draco finished his latest run-through of the preliminary gestures, the part of the spell that was difficult to learn; the final brandish and the pronunciation didn’t have to be precise. All three of the last runs had been perfect as far as Harry could see. Harry had also felt an odd impulse to adjust things that Mr Lupin hadn’t said anything about, like the angle of Draco’s elbow or the direction his foot was point- ing; it could have been entirely his own imagination, and probably was, but Harry had decided to go with it just in case. “All right,” Harry said quietly. There was a tension in his chest that made it a little hard to speak. “Now we don’t have a Dementor here, but that’s all right. We won’t need one. Draco, when your father spoke to me at the train station, he said that you were the one thing in the world that was most precious to him, and he threatened to throw away all his other plans to take vengeance on me, if ever you came to harm.” “He…what?” There was a catch in Draco’s voice, and a strange look on his face. “Why are you telling me that?” “Why wouldn’t I?” Harry didn’t let his expression change, though he could guess what Draco was thinking; that Harry had been plotting to sep- arate Draco from his father, and shouldn’t be saying anything that would bring them closer together. “There’s always been just one person who mat- ters most to you, and I know exactly what warm and happy thought will let you cast the Patronus Charm. You told it to me at the train station before the first day of school. Once you fell off a broomstick and broke your ribs. It hurt more than anything you’d ever felt, and you thought you were go- ing to die. Pretend that fear is coming from a Dementor, standing in front of you, wearing a tattered black cloak, looking like a dead thing left in wa- ter. And then cast the Patronus Charm, and when you brandish the wand to drive the Dementor away, think of how your father held your hand, so that you wouldn’t be afraid; and then think of how much he loves you, and how much you love him, and put it all into your voice when you say Ex- pecto Patronum. For the honour of House Malfoy, and not just because you promised me a favour. Show me you didn’t lie to me that day in the train station when you told me Lucius was a good father. Show me you can do what Salazar Slytherin could do.” And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, out of Draco’s field of vi- sion, so that Draco only faced the dusty old teacher’s desk and blackboard at the front of the unused classroom. Draco cast one look behind him, that strange look still on his face, and then turned away to face forward. Harry saw the exhalation, the in- halation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice, and four times. Draco’s fingers slid along the wand, exactly the right distances— Draco lowered his wand. “This is too—” Draco said, “I can’t think this right, while you’re watching—” Harry turned around and started walking toward the door. “I’ll come back in a minute,” Harry said. “Just hold to your happy thought, and the Patronus will stay.” 751 CH APTER 47 752 PERSONHOOD THEORY 753 CH APTER 47 754 PERSONHOOD THEORY 755 CH APTER 47 756 PERSONHOOD THEORY 757 CH APTER 47 Draco thought for a while, with his palms over his eyes to shut out the world, no sound but his and Harry’s breathing. All the persuasive reason- ableness of what Harry said, the evident grains of truth that it contained; and against that, the obvious, the perfectly and entirely obvious hypothe- sis about what was really going on… After a time, Draco finally raised his head. “It sounds right,” Draco said quietly. A huge smile broke out on Harry’s face. “So,” Draco continued, “is this where you bring me to Dumbledore, to make it official?” He kept his voice very casual as he said it. “Oh, yeah,” Harry said. “That was the thing I was going to ask you about, actually—” Draco’s blood froze in his veins, froze solid and shattered— “Professor Quirrell said something to me that got me thinking, and, well, no matter how you answer this question, I’m already stupid for hav- ing not asked you a lot earlier. Everyone in Gryffindor thinks Dumbledore is a saint, the Hufflepuffs think he’s crazy, the Ravenclaws are all proud of themselves for having worked out that he’s only pretending to be crazy, but I never asked anyone in Slytherin. I’m supposed to know better than to make that sort of mistake. But if even you think Dumbledore’s okay to conspire with on fixing Slytherin House, I guess I didn’t miss anything important.” … … … “You know,” Draco said, his voice remarkably calm, all things consid- ered, “every time I wonder if you do things like this just to annoy me, I tell myself that it has to be accidental, no-one could possibly do this sort of thing on purpose even if they tried until blood trickled out of their ears. That’s the only reason I’m not going to strangle you now.” “Huh?” And then strangle himself, because Harry had grown up with Mug- gles, and then Dumbledore had smoothly diverted him from Slytherin to Ravenclaw, so it was perfectly plausible that Harry might not know anything, and Draco had never thought to tell him. Or else Harry had guessed that Draco wouldn’t join up with Dum- bledore so readily, and this itself was just the next step of Dumbledore’s plan… But if Harry really didn’t know about Dumbledore, then warning him had to take precedence over everything. “All right,” Draco said, after he’d had a chance to organize his thoughts. “I don’t know where to start, so I’ll just start somewhere.” Draco drew a deep breath. This was going to take a while. “Dumbledore murdered his little sister, and got away with it because his brother wouldn’t testify against him—” 759 CH APTER 47 760 PERSONHOOD THEORY 761 CH APTER 47 762 PERSONHOOD THEORY In a classroom filled with soft silver light, one boy is staring at another boy, who is sobbing, wiping frantically at his eyes with the sleeves of his robes. It was hard for Harry to stay balanced, to keep withholding judge- ment, it was too emotional, there was something that either wanted to start tears from his own eyes in sympathy with Draco, or know that it wasn’t true… Dumbledore burned her to death in her own bedroom! That… …didn’t sound like Dumbledore’s style… …but you could only think that thought so many times, before you started to wonder about the trustworthiness of that whole ‘style’ concept. “It, it must have hurt horribly,” Draco said, his voice shaking, “Father never talks about it at all, you don’t ever talk about it in front of him, but Mr Macnair told me, there were scorch marks all over the bedroom, from how Mother must have struggled while Dumbledore burned her alive. That is the debt Dumbledore owes to House Malfoy and we will have his life for it!” “Draco,” Harry said, he let all of the hoarseness into his own voice, it would be wrong to sound calm, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry for asking, but I have to know, how do you know it was Dumble—” “Dumbledore said he did it, he told Father it was a warning! And Fa- ther couldn’t testify under Veritaserum because he was an Occlumens, he couldn’t even get Dumbledore put on trial, Father’s own allies didn’t be- lieve him after Dumbledore just denied everything in public, but we know, the Death Eaters know, Father wouldn’t have any reason to lie about that, Father would want us to take revenge on the right person, can’t you see that Harry?” Draco’s voice was wild. Unless Lucius did it himself, of course, and found it more convenient to blame Dumbledore. Although…it also didn’t seem like Lucius’s style. And if he had mur- dered Narcissa, it would have been smarter to pin the blame on an eas- ier victim instead of losing political capital and credibility by going after Dumbledore… In time, Draco stopped crying, and looked at Harry. “Well?” said Draco, sounding like he wanted to spit the words. “Is that evil enough for you, Mr Potter?” Harry looked down at where his arms rested on the back of his chair. He couldn’t meet Draco’s eyes any more, the pain in them was too raw. “I wasn’t expecting to hear that,” Harry said softly. “I don’t know what to think any more.” “You don’t know?” Draco’s voice rose to a shriek, and he stood up abruptly from his desk— “I remembered the Dark Lord killing my parents,” Harry said. “When I went in front of the Dementor the first time, that was what I remembered, the worst memory. Even though it was so long ago. I heard them dying. My mother begged the Dark Lord not to kill me, not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead! That’s what she said. And the Dark Lord mocked her, and laughed. Then, I remember, the flash of green light—” Harry looked up at Draco. “So we could fight,” Harry said, “we could just keep on with the same fight. You could tell me that it was right for my mother to die, because she was the wife of James, who killed a Death Eater. But bad for your mother to die, because she was innocent. And I could tell you that it was right for your mother to die, that Dumbledore must have had some reason that made it okay to burn her alive in her own bedroom; but bad for my mother to die. But you know, Draco, either way, wouldn’t it be obvious that we were just being biased? Because the rule that says that it’s wrong to kill innocent people, that rule can’t switch on for my mother and off for yours, and it can’t switch on for your mother and off for mine. If you tell me that Lily was an enemy of the Death Eaters and it’s right to kill your enemies, then the same rule says that Dumbledore was right to kill Narcissa, since she was his enemy.” Harry’s voice went hoarse. “So if the two of us are going to agree on anything, it’s going to be that neither of their deaths were right and that no-one’s mother should die any more.” 765 CH APTER 47 766 PERSONHOOD THEORY 767 CH APTER 47 Draco pushed open the door to which the portraits had directed them, and this time it was the right door. Before them was a small empty place of stone set against the night sky. Not a roof like the one he’d dropped Harry from, but a tiny and proper courtyard, far above the ground. With proper railings, elaborate traceries of stone that flushed seamlessly into the stone floor…How so much artistry had been infused into the creation of Hog- warts was something that still awed Draco every time he thought about it. There must have been some way to do it all at once, no-one could have detailed so much piece by piece, the castle changed and every new piece was like that. It was so far beyond the wizardry of these fading days that no-one would have believed it if they hadn’t seen the proof in Hogwarts itself. Cloudless and cold, the winter night sky; it got dark long before stu- dents’ curfew, in the final days of January. The stars shining brightly, in the clear air. Harry had said that being under the stars would help him. Draco touched his chest with his wand, slid his fingers in a practised motion, and said, “Thermos.” A warmth spread through him, starting from his heart; the wind went on blowing on his face, but he was no longer cold. “Thermos,” Harry’s voice said behind him. They went together to the railing, to look down at the ground a long way below. Draco tried to figure if they were in one of the towers that could be seen from outside, and found that right now he couldn’t quite seem to picture how Hogwarts looked from outside. But the ground below was always the same; he could see the Forbidden Forest as a vague outline, and moonlight glittering from the Hogwarts Lake. “You know,” Harry’s voice said quietly from beside him where his arms leaned on the railing next to Draco’s, “one of the things that Mug- gles get really wrong, is that they don’t turn all their lights out at night. Not even for one hour every month, not even for fifteen minutes once a year. The photons scatter in the atmosphere and wash out all but the brightest stars, and the night sky doesn’t look the same at all, not unless you go far away from any cities. Once you’ve looked up at the sky over Hogwarts, it’s hard to imagine living in a Muggle city, where you wouldn’t be able to see the stars. You certainly wouldn’t want to spend your whole life in Muggle cities, once you’d seen the night sky over Hogwarts.” Draco glanced at Harry, and found that Harry was craning his neck to stare up at where the Milky Way arched across the darkness. “Of course,” Harry went on, his voice still quiet, “you can’t ever see the stars properly from Earth, either, the air always gets in the way. You have to look from somewhere else, if you want to see the real thing, the stars burning hard and bright, like their true selves. Have you ever wished that you could just whisk yourself up into the night sky, Draco, and go and look at what there is to see around other Suns than ours? If there were no limit to the power of your magic, is that one of the things you would do, if you could do anything?” There was a silence, and then Draco realized that he was expected to answer. “I didn’t think of it before,” Draco said. Without any conscious decision, his voice came out as soft and hushed as Harry’s. “Do you really think anyone would ever be able to do that?” “I don’t think it’ll be that easy,” said Harry. “But I know I don’t mean to spend my whole life on Earth.” It would have been something to laugh at, if Draco hadn’t known that some Muggles had already left, without even using magic. “To pass your test,” Harry said, “I’m going to have to say what it means to me, that thought, the whole thing, not the shorter version I tried to explain to you before. But you should be able to see it’s the same idea, only more general. So my version of the thought, Draco, is that when we go out into the stars, we might find other people there. And if so, they certainly won’t look like we do. There might be things out there that are grown from crystal, or big pulsating blobs…or they might be made of magic, now that I think about it. So with all that strangeness, how do you recognize a person? Not by the shape, not by how many arms or legs it has. Not by the sort of substance it’s made out of, whether that’s flesh or crystal or stuff I can’t imagine. You would have to recognize them as people from their minds. And even their minds wouldn’t work just like ours do. But anything that lives and thinks and knows itself and doesn’t want to die, it’s sad, Draco, it’s sad if that person has to die, because it doesn’t want to. Compared to what might be out there, every human being who ever lived, we’re all like brothers and sisters, you could hardly even tell us apart. The ones out there who met us, they wouldn’t see British or French, they wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, they’d just see a human being. Humans who can love, and hate, and laugh, and cry; and to them, the ones out there, that would make us all as alike as peas in the same pod. They would be different, though. Really different. But that wouldn’t stop us, and it wouldn’t stop them, if we both wanted to be friends together.” Harry raised his wand then, and Draco turned, and looked away, as he had promised; looked toward the stone floor and stone wall in which the door was set. For Draco had promised not to look, and not to tell anyone of what Harry had said, or anything at all of what happened here this night, though he didn’t know why it was to be so secret. “I have a dream,” said Harry’s voice, “that one day sentient beings will be judged by the patterns of their minds, and not their colour or their shape or the stuff they’re made of, or who their parents were. Because if we can get along with crystal things some day, how silly would it be not to get along with Muggle-borns, who are shaped like us, and think like us, as alike to us as peas in a pod? The crystal things wouldn’t even be able to tell the difference. How impossible is it to imagine that the hatred poi- soning Slytherin House would be worth taking with us to the stars? Every life is precious, everything that thinks and knows itself and doesn’t want to die. Lily Potter’s life was precious, and Narcissa Malfoy’s life was pre- cious, even though it’s too late for them now, it was sad when they died. But there are other lives that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and my life, and Hermione Granger’s life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond, to be defended and protected, EXPECTO PATRONUM!” And there was light. Everything turned to silver in that light, the stone floor, the stone wall, the door, the railings, so dazzling just in the reflection that you could hardly even see them, even the air seemed to shine, and the light grew brighter, and brighter, and brighter— When the light ended it was like a shock, Draco’s hand went automat- ically to his robe to bring out a handkerchief, and it was only then that he realized he was crying. “There is your experimental result,” Harry’s voice said quietly. “I really did mean it, that thought.” Draco slowly turned toward Harry, who had lowered his wand now. “That, that’s got to be a trick, right?” Draco said. He couldn’t take many more of these shocks. “Your Patronus—can’t really be that bright—” And yet it had been Patronus light, once you knew what you were looking at, you couldn’t mistake it for anything else. “That was the true form of the Patronus Charm,” Harry said. “Some- thing that lets you put all your strength into the Patronus, without hin- drance from within yourself. And before you ask, I did not learn it from Dumbledore. He does not know the secret, and could not cast the true form if he did. I solved the puzzle for myself. And I knew, once I under- stood, that this spell must not be spoken of. For your sake, I undertook your test; but you must not speak of it, Draco.” Draco didn’t know any more, he didn’t know where the true strength lay, or the right of things. Double vision, double vision. Draco wanted to call Harry’s ideals weakness, Hufflepuff foolishness, the sort of lie that rulers told to placate the populace and that Harry had been silly enough to believe for himself, foolishness taken seriously and raised up to insane heights, projected out onto the stars themselves— Something beautiful and hidden, mysterious and bright— “Will I,” whispered Draco, “be able to cast a Patronus like that, some day?” “If you always keep seeking the truth,” Harry said, “and if you don’t refuse the warm thoughts when you find them, then I’m sure you will. I think a person could get anywhere if they just kept going long enough, even to the stars.” Draco wiped his eyes with his handkerchief again. “We should go back inside,” Draco said in an unsteady voice, “someone could’ve seen it, all that light—” Harry nodded, and moved to and through the door; and Draco looked up at the night sky one last time before he followed. Who was the Boy-Who-Lived, that he was already an Occlumens, and could cast the true form of the Patronus Charm, and do other strange things? What was Harry’s Patronus, why must it stay unseen? Draco didn’t ask any of those questions, because Harry might have answered, and Draco just couldn’t take any more shocks today. He just couldn’t. One more shock and his head was going to just fall right off his shoulders and go bounce, bounce, bounce down the corridors of Hogwarts. 773 CH APTER 47 774 PERSONHOOD THEORY Harry had claimed that the idea wasn’t all that strange and he didn’t see how it could possibly shock Draco in any way, which made Draco feel even more nervous, somehow; but Draco could see how important it was to have a way of sending messages in emergencies. The trick—or so Harry hypothesized—was wanting to spread the good news, wanting the recipient to know the truth of whatever happy thought you’d used to cast the Patronus Charm. Only instead of telling the recip- ient in words, the Patronus itself was the message. By wanting them to see that, the Patronus would go to them. “Tell Harry,” said Draco to the luminous snake, even though Harry was standing only a few paces away on the other side of the room, “to, um, beware the green monkey,” this being a sign from a play Draco had once seen. And then, just like at King’s Cross station, Draco wanted Harry to know that Father had always cared for him; only this time he didn’t try to say it in words, but wanted to say it with the happy thought itself. The bright snake slithered across the room, looking more like it was slithering through the air rather than the stone itself; it got to Harry after travelling that short distance— —and said to Harry, in a strange voice that Draco recognized as how he himself probably sounded to other people, “Beware the green monkey.” “Hsssss sss sshsshsss,” said Harry. The snake slithered back across the floor to Draco. “Harry says the message is received and acknowledged,” said the shin- ing Blue Krait in Draco’s voice. “Huh,” Harry said. “Talking to Patronuses feels odd.” … … … … “Why are you looking at me like that?” said the Heir of Slytherin. 776 777 779 CH APTER 48 780 UTILITARIAN PRIORITIES Terry hadn’t heard of anything like that. Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had asked. And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down again, staring at his plate of vegetables with a forlorn expression. He was getting hungrier, and later in the day he would be visiting Mary’s Place for one of their incredibly tasty dishes…Harry was finding himself sorely tempted to just revert back to yesterday’s eating habits and be done with it. You’ve got to eat something, said his inner Slytherin. And it’s not all that much more likely that anyone sneezed self-awareness onto poultry than onto plants, so as long as you’re eating food of questionable sentience either way, why not eat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices? I’m not quite sure that’s valid utilitarian logic, there— Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian logic coming up: even in the unlikely chance that some moron did manage to confer sentience on chick- ens, it’s your research that stands the best chance of discovering the fact and doing something about it. If you can complete your work even slightly faster by not mess- ing around with your diet, then, counterintuitive as it may seem, the best thing you can do to save the greatest number of possibly-sentient who-knows-whats is not wasting time on wild guesses about what might be intelligent. It’s not like the house elves haven’t prepared the food already, regardless of what you take onto your plate. Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive line of reasoning— Good! said Slytherin. I’m glad you see now that the most moral thing to do is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings for your own convenience, to feed your dread- ful appetites, for the sick pleasure of ripping them apart with your teeth— What? Harry thought indignantly. Which side are you on here? His inner Slytherin’s mental voice was grim. You too will some day em- brace the doctrine…that the end justifies the meats. This was followed by some mental snickering. Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be sen- tient, his non-Ravenclaw parts had been having trouble taking his moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting Cannibalism! every time Harry tried to think about any food item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would vi- sualize it screaming while he ate it, even if it was, say, a sandwich— Cannibalism! AIIIEEEE DON’T EAT ME— Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It’s a safe place to compromise your ethics in the service of higher goals, everyone else thinks it’s okay to eat sandwiches so you can’t use your usual rationalization about a small probability of a large downside if you get caught— Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, Just so long as you’re okay with us being eaten by giant monsters that didn’t do enough research into whether we were sentient. I’m okay with that, said Slytherin. Is everyone else okay with that? (Internal mental nods.) Great, can we go back to deep-fried Diracawl slices now? Not until I’ve done some more research into what’s sentient and what isn’t. Now shut up. And Harry turned firmly away from his plate full of oh-so- tempting vegetables to head toward the library— Just eat the students, said Hufflepuff. There’s no doubt about whether they’re sentient. You know you want to, said Gryffindor. I bet the young ones are the tastiest. Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged their imaginary personalities. 782 UTILITARIAN PRIORITIES 783 CH APTER 48 784 UTILITARIAN PRIORITIES 785 CH APTER 48 786 UTILITARIAN PRIORITIES 787 789 CH APTER 49 79 0 PRIOR INFORMATION “I shall have a bowl of green lentil soup, with soy sauce,” Professor Quirrell said to the waitress. “And for Mr Potter, a plate of Tenorman’s family chilli.” Harry hesitated in sudden dismay. He’d resolved to stick to vegetar- ian dishes for the moment, but he’d forgotten in his deliberations that Professor Quirrell did the actual ordering—and it would be awkward if he protested now— The waitress bowed to them, and turned to go— “Erm, excuse me, any meat in that from snakes or flying squirrels?” The waitress didn’t so much as blink an eye, only turned back to Harry, shook her head, bowed politely to him again, and resumed her walk to- ward the door. (The other parts of Harry were snickering at him. Gryffindor was mak- ing sardonic comments about how a little social discomfort was enough to get him to resort to Cannibalism! (shouted by Hufflepuff), and Slytherin was remarking on how nice it was that Harry’s ethics were flexible when it came to important goals like maintaining his relationship with Professor Quirrell.) After the waitress had closed the door behind her, Professor Quirrell waved a hand to slide home the locking bar, spoke the usual four Charms to ensure privacy, and then said, “An interesting question, Mr Potter. I wonder why you asked it?” Harry kept his face steady. “I was looking up some facts about the Pa- tronus Charm earlier,” he said. “According to The Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn’t, it turns out that Godric couldn’t and Salazar could. I was surprised, so I looked up the reference, in Four Lives of Power. And then I discovered that Salazar Slytherin could supposedly talk to snakes.” (Temporal sequence wasn’t the same as causation, it wasn’t Harry’s fault if Professor Quirrell missed that.) “Further research turned up an old story about a mother goddess type who could talk to flying squirrels. I was a bit worried about the prospect of eating something that could talk.” And Harry took a casual sip of his water— —just as Professor Quirrell said, “Mr Potter, would I be correct in guessing that you are also a Parselmouth?” When Harry was done coughing, he set his glass of water back down on the table, fixed his gaze on Professor Quirrell’s chin rather than looking him in the eyes, and said, “So you are able to perform Legilimency through my Occlumency barriers, then.” Professor Quirrell was grinning widely. “I shall take that as a compli- ment, Mr Potter, but no.” “I’m not buying this any more,” Harry said. “There’s no way you came to that conclusion based on that evidence.” “Of course not,” Professor Quirrell said equably. “I had planned to ask you that question today in any case, and simply chose an opportune mo- ment. I have suspected since December, in fact—” “December?” said Harry. “I found out yesterday!” “Ah, so you did not realize the Sorting Hat’s message to you was in Parseltongue?” The Defence Professor had timed it exactly right the second time, too, just as Harry was taking a gulp of water to clear out his throat from the first coughing fit. Harry hadn’t realized, not until just now. Of course it was obvious the instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right, Professor McGonagall had even told him not to talk to snakes where anyone could see him, but he’d thought she’d meant not to be seen talking to any statues or architectural features in Hogwarts that looked like snakes. Double illusion of trans- parency, he’d thought he understood her, she’d thought he understood her—but how the hell— “So,” Harry said, “you performed Legilimency on me during my first Defence class, to find out what happened with the Sorting Hat—” “Then I would not have found out in December.” Professor Quirrell leaned back, smiling. “This is not a puzzle you can solve on your own, Mr Potter, so I will reveal the answer. Over the winter holiday, I was alerted to the fact that the Headmaster had filed a request for a closed ju- dicial panel to review the case of one Mr Rubeus Hagrid, whom you know as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, and who was accused of the murder of Abigail Myrtle in 1943.” “Oh, of course,” said Harry, “that makes it downright obvious that I’m a Parselmouth. Professor, what the sweet slithering snakes—” “The other suspect for that murder was Slytherin’s Monster, the leg- endary inhabitant of Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets. Which is why cer- tain sources alerted me to the fact, and why it caught my attention suffi- ciently that I spent a good deal of bribe money to learn the details of the case. Now in point of fact, Mr Potter, Mr Hagrid is innocent. Ridiculously obviously innocent. He is the most blatantly innocent bystander to be con- victed by the magical British legal system since Grindelwald’s Confund- ing of Neville Chamberlain was pinned on Amanda Knox. Headmaster Dippet prompted a student puppet to accuse Mr Hagrid because Dippet needed a scapegoat to take the blame for the death of Miss Myrtle, and our marvellous justice system agreed that this was plausible enough to warrant Mr Hagrid’s expulsion and the snapping of his wand. Our current Headmaster needs merely provide some new item of evidence significant enough to reconvene the case; and with Dumbledore applying pressure instead of Dippet, the result is a foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy has no particular reason to fear Mr Hagrid’s vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will only resist to the extent that he can do so without penalty in order to impose costs on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willing to pros- ecute the case regardless.” Professor Quirrell took a sip of his water. “But I digress. The new evi- dence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to exhibit a previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which, the Headmaster asserts, he has personally determined to respond only to Slytherins who are also Parselmouths. The Headmaster further argues that this favours the in- terpretation that the Chamber of Secrets was indeed opened in 1943, approximately the right time frame for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a known Parselmouth, to have attended Hogwarts. It is a rather ques- tionable logic, but a judicial panel may rule that it swings the case far enough to bring Mr Hagrid’s guilt into doubt, if they can manage to keep a straight face as they say it. And now we come to the key question: how did the Headmaster discover this hidden spell on the Sorting Hat?” Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. “Well now, let us suppose that there was a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of students, a potential Heir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr Potter, that you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary people are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new Slytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded by the Headmaster, specifically hunting the mem- ories of his Sorting, why, you stand out even more.” The smile vanished. “So you see, Mr Potter, it was not I who invaded your mind, though I will not ask you to apologize. It is not your fault that you believed Dumble- dore’s protestations of respecting your mental privacy.” “My sincere apologies,” Harry said, keeping his face expressionless. The rigid control was a confession in its own right, as was the sweat bead- ing his forehead; but he didn’t think the Defence Professor would take any evidence from that. Professor Quirrell would just think Harry was ner- vous at having been discovered as the Heir of Slytherin. Rather than being nervous that Professor Quirrell might realize that Harry had deliberately betrayed Slytherin’s secret…which itself was no longer seeming like such a smart move. “So, Mr Potter. Any progress on finding the Chamber of Secrets?” No, thought Harry. But to maintain plausible deniability, you needed a general policy of sometimes evading questions even when you had nothing to hide…“With respect, Professor Quirrell, if I had made such progress, it is not quite obvious to me that I should tell you about it.” Professor Quirrell sipped from his own water glass again. “Well then, Mr Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or suspect. First, I believe the Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin’s Monster. Miss Myrtle’s death was not discovered until hours after her demise, even though the wards should have alerted the Headmaster instantly. Therefore her mur- der was performed either by Headmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or by some entity which Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popu- lar legend, the purpose of Slytherin’s Monster was not to rid Hogwarts of Muggle-borns. Unless Slytherin’s Monster were powerful enough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers, it could not tri- umph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would result in the school’s closure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in the placing of new wards. So why Slytherin’s Monster, Mr Potter? What true purpose does it serve?” “Ah…” Harry dropped his gaze to his water glass and tried to think. “To kill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn’t belong there—” “A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that had bro- ken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Chamber? Unlikely.” Harry was feeling a bit pressured now. “Well, it’s called the Chamber of Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or is a secret?” For that matter, just what sort of secrets were in the Chamber of Secrets in the first place? Harry hadn’t done a lot of research on the subject, in part because he’d got the impression that nobody knew anything— Professor Quirrell was smiling. “Why not just write the secret down?” “Ahhh…” said Harry. “Because if the Monster spoke Parseltongue, that would ensure that only a true descendant of Slytherin could hear the se- cret?” “Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase spoken in Parseltongue. Why go to the trouble of creating Slytherin’s Monster? It cannot have been easy to create a creature with a lifespan of centuries. Come, Mr Potter, it should be obvious; what are the secrets that can be told from one living mind to another, but never written down?” Harry saw it then, with a burst of adrenaline that started his heart racing, his breath coming faster. “Oh.” Salazar Slytherin had been very cunning indeed. Cunning enough to come up with a way to bypass the Interdict of Merlin. Powerful wizardries couldn’t be transmitted through books or ghosts, but if you could create a long-lived enough sentient creature with a good enough memory— “It seems very probable to me,” said Professor Quirrell, “that He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to power with secrets ob- tained from Slytherin’s Monster. That Salazar’s lost knowledge is the source of You-Know-Who’s extraordinarily powerful wizardry. Hence my interest in the Chamber of Secrets and the case of Mr Hagrid.” “I see,” Harry said. And if he, Harry, could find Salazar’s Chamber of Secrets…then all of the lost knowledge that Lord Voldemort had obtained would be his as well. Yes. That was just how the story should go. Add in Harry’s superior intelligence and some original magical re- search and some Muggle rocket launchers, and the resulting fight would be completely one-sided, which was exactly how Harry wanted it. Harry was grinning now, a very evil grin. New priority: Find everything in Hogwarts that looks remotely like a snake and try speaking to it. Starting with everything you’ve already tried, only this time be sure to use Parseltongue instead of English—get Draco to let you into the Slytherin dorms— “Don’t become too excited, Mr Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. His own face had become expressionless, now. “You must continue thinking. What were the Dark Lord’s parting words to Slytherin’s Monster?” “What?” Harry said. “How could either of us possibly know that?” “Visualize the scene, Mr Potter. Let your imagination fill in the details. Slytherin’s Monster—probably some great serpent, so that only a Parsel- mouth may speak to it—has finished imparting all of the knowledge it possesses to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It conveys to him Salazar’s final benediction, and warns him that the Chamber of Secrets must now remain closed until the next descendant of Salazar should prove cunning enough to open it. And he who will become the Dark Lord nods, and says to it—” “Avada Kedavra,” said Harry, suddenly feeling sick to his stomach. “Rule Twelve,” Professor Quirrell said quietly. “Never leave the source of your power lying around where someone else can find it.” Harry’s gaze dropped to the tablecloth, which had decorated itself in a mournful pattern of black flowers and shadows. Somehow that seemed… too sad to be imagined, Slytherin’s great snake had only wanted to help Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had just…there was something un- bearably sorrowful about it, what sort of person would do that to a being who’d offered them nothing but friendship…“Do you think the Dark Lord would have—” “Yes,” Professor Quirrell said flatly. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named left quite a trail of bodies behind him, Mr Potter; I doubt he would have omitted that one. If there were any artifacts left there that could be moved, the Dark Lord would have taken those with him as well. There might still be something worth seeing in the Chamber of Secrets, and to find it would prove yourself the true Heir of Slytherin. But do not raise your hopes too high. I suspect that all you will find is the remains of Slytherin’s Monster resting quietly in its grave.” They sat in silence for a while. “I could be wrong,” said Professor Quirrell. “In the end it is only a guess. But I did wish to warn you, Mr Potter, so that you would not be too sorely disappointed.” Harry nodded shortly. “One might even regret your infant self’s victory,” said Professor Quir- rell. His smile twisted. “If only You-Know-Who had lived, you might have persuaded him to teach you some of the knowledge that would have been your heritage, from one Heir of Slytherin to another.” The smile twisted further, as though to mock the obvious impossibility, even given the premise. Note to self, thought Harry, with a slight chill and an edge of anger, make sure to extract my heritage out of the Dark Lord’s mind, one way or another. There was another silence. Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as though waiting for him to ask something. “Well,” said Harry, “so long as we’re on the topic, can I ask how you think the whole Parselmouth business actually—” There came a knock at the door, then. Professor Quirrell raised a cau- tionary finger, then opened the door with a wave. The waitress entered, balancing a huge platter with their meals as though the whole assembly weighed nothing (which was in fact probably the case). She gave Pro- fessor Quirrell his bowl of green soup, and a glass of his usual Chianti; and set down before Harry a plate of small meat strips smothered in a heavy-looking sauce, plus a glass of his accustomed treacle soda. Then she bowed, managing to make it seem like sincere respect rather than perfunctory acknowledgement, and departed. When she was gone, Professor Quirrell held up a finger for silence again, and drew his wand. And then Professor Quirrell began performing a certain series of in- cantations that Harry recognized, making him take a sharp breath. It was the series and ordering that Mr Bester had used, the full set of twenty- seven spells that you would perform before discussing anything of truly great import. If the discussion of the Chamber of Secrets hadn’t counted as important— When Professor Quirrell was done—he’d performed thirty spells, three of which Harry hadn’t heard before—the Defence Professor said, “Now we shall not be interrupted for a time. Can you keep a secret, Mr Potter?” Harry nodded. “A serious secret, Mr Potter,” Professor Quirrell said. His eyes were intent, his face grave. “One which could potentially send me to Azkaban. Think about it before you reply.” For a moment Harry didn’t even see why the question should be hard, given his growing collection of secrets. Then— If this secret could send Professor Quirrell to Azkaban, that means he’s done something illegal… Harry’s brain performed a few calculations. Whatever the secret, Pro- fessor Quirrell did not think his illegal act would reflect badly on him in Harry’s eyes. There was no advantage to be gained from not hearing it. And if it did reveal something wrong with Professor Quirrell, then it was very much to Harry’s advantage to know it, even if he had promised not to tell anyone. “I never had very much respect for authority,” Harry said. “Legal and governmental authority included. I will keep your secret.” Harry didn’t bother asking whether the revelation was worth the danger it would pose to Professor Quirrell. The Defence Professor wasn’t stupid. “Then I must test whether you are truly a descendant of Salazar,” said Professor Quirrell, and stood up from his chair. Harry, prompted more by reflex and instinct than calculation, shoved himself up out of his own chair as well. There was a blur, a shift, a sudden motion. Harry aborted his panicked backward leap halfway through, leaving him wind-milling his arms and trying not to fall over, a frantic flush of adrenaline running through him. At the other end of the room swayed a snake a metre high, bright green and intricately banded in white and blue. Harry didn’t know enough snake lore to recognize it, but he knew that ‘brightly coloured’ meant ‘poisonous’. The constant sense of doom had diminished, ironically enough, after the Defence Professor of Hogwarts had turned into a venomous snake. Harry swallowed hard and said, “Greetings—ah, hssss, no, ah, greet- ingss.” “So,” hissed the snake. “You sspeak, I hear. I sspeak, you hear?” “Yess, I hear,” hissed Harry. “You are an Animaguss?” “Obvioussly,” hissed the snake. “Thirty-sseven ruless, number thirty-four: Be- come Animaguss. All ssenssible people do, if can. Thuss, very rare.” The snake’s eyes were flat surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils in dark grey fields. “Thiss iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You ssee? No otherss undersstand uss.” “Even if they are ssnake Animagi?” “Not unlesss heir of Slytherin willss.” The snake gave a series of short hisses which Harry’s brain translated as sardonic laughter. “Slytherin not sstupid. Snake Animaguss not ssame ass Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.” Well that definitely argued that Parseltongue was personal magic, not snakes being sentient beings with a learnable language— “I am not regisstered,” hissed the snake. The dark pits of its eyes stared at Harry. “Animaguss musst be regisstered. Penalty iss two yearss imprissonment. Will you keep my ssecret, boy?” “Yess,” hissed Harry. “Would never break promisse.” The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then began to sway again. “We come here next in sseven dayss. Bring cloak to passs unsseen, bring hourglasss to move through time—” “You know?” hissed Harry in shock. “How—” Again the series of short quick hisses that translated as sardonic laughter. “You arrive in my firsst classs while sstill in other classs, sstrike down enemy with pie, two ballss of memory—” “Never mind,” hissed Harry. “Stupid quesstion, forgot you were ssmart.” “Foolissh thing to forget,” said the snake, but the hiss did not seem of- fended. “Hourglasss iss resstricted,” Harry said. “Cannot usse until ninth hour.” The snake twitched its head, a snakish nod. “Many resstrictionss. Locked to your usse only, cannot be sstolen. Cannot transsport other humanss. But ssnake carried in pouch, I ssusspect will go with. Think posssible to hold hourglasss motion- lesss within sshell, without dissturbing wardss, while you turn sshell around it. We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond thiss. You ssay nothing, to no-one. Give no ssign of expectancy, none. Undersstand?” Harry nodded. “Speak.” “Yess.” “Will do ass I ssaid?” “Yess. But,” Harry gave a wobbling rasp that was how his mind had translated a hesitant ‘Ahhh’ into snakish, “I do not promissse to do whatever thisss isss, you have not sssaid—” The snake performed a shiver that Harry’s mind translated as a severe glare. “Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspecificss at next meeting.” The blur and motion reversed itself, and Professor Quirrell was stand- ing there once more. For a moment the Defence Professor himself seemed to sway, as the snake had swayed, and his eyes seemed cold and flat; and then his shoulders straightened and he was human once more. And the aura of doom had returned. Professor Quirrell’s chair scooted back for him, and he sat down in it. “No sense in letting this go to waste,” Professor Quirrell said as he picked up his spoon, “though at the moment I would much prefer a live mouse. One can never quite disentangle the mind from the body it wears, you see…” Harry slowly took his seat and began eating. 801 CH APTER 49 802 803 CH APTER 5 0 804 SELF CE NTERE DNESS 805 CH APTER 5 0 806 SELF CE NTERE DNESS 807 CH APTER 5 0 808 SELF CE NTERE DNESS And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides lomil- lialor wood—even her fear of falling back into harmony with Parvati, which she’d never talked about with anyone before, but then Harry’s ghostly ally already knew. And Harry had reached into his pouch and pulled out some odd books, loaning them to her on condition of complete secrecy, saying that if she could comprehend those books it would change the pattern of her thinking enough that she’d never fall into harmony with Parvati again… At nine o’clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was only half done. And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and said that he thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made her feel good for a whole minute before she realized what had just been said to her and who had said it. 809 CH APTER 5 0 Earlier “I told you to be nicer!” shrieked Hermione. Harry was starting to sweat. He’d never actually heard Hermione scream at him before, and it was quite loud in the empty classroom. “I—but—but I was nice!” Harry protested. “I practically redeemed her, Padma was going down the wrong path and I turned her off it! I prob- ably changed her whole life to be happier! Besides, you should’ve heard the original version of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do—” at which point Harry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a second too late. Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn’t seen from her before. “What’d he say to do? Kill her?” The Defence Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the key influential students inside and outside his year and try to gain control of the entire Hogwarts rumour mill, remarking that this was a generally useful and amusing challenge for any true Slytherin attending Hogwarts. “Nothing like that,” Harry said quickly, “he just said in a general way that I should get influence over the people spreading rumours, and I de- cided that the nice version of that would be to just inform Padma directly about the meaning of what she was doing, and the possible consequences of her actions, instead of trying to threaten her or anything like that—” “You call that not threatening someone?” Hermione’s hands were pulling at her hair now. “Um…” Harry said. “I guess she might’ve felt a little threatened, but Hermione, people will do whatever they think they can get away with, they don’t care about how much it hurts other people if it doesn’t hurt them- selves, if Padma thinks there’s no consequences to spreading lies about you then of course she’ll just go on doing it—” “And you think there’s going to be no consequences to what you did?” Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach. Hermione had the angriest look on her that he’d ever seen. “What do you think the other students think of you now, Harry? Of me? If Harry doesn’t like the way you talk about Hermione, you’ll get ghosts set on you, is that what you want them to think?” Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just…hadn’t thought about it that way, actually… Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where she’d slammed them. “I’m not talking to you for a week, and I’ll tell everyone I’m not talking to you for a week, and I’ll tell them why, and maybe that’ll undo some of what you just did. And after that week, I’ll—I’ll decide then what to do, I guess—” “Hermione!” Harry’s own voice rose to a shriek of desperation. “I was trying to help!” The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the classroom door. “Harry,” she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the anger, “Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he really is, I mean it, Harry.” “This…wasn’t him, this wasn’t what he said to do, this was just me—” Hermione’s voice was almost a whisper now. “Someday you’re going to go out to lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that comes back, or maybe even you won’t come back at all.” “I promise you,” Harry said, “that I will come back from lunch.” He wasn’t even thinking as he said it. And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed the door behind her. Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron, observed Harry’s Internal Critic. Now you’re going to die this Saturday, your last words will be ‘I’m sorry, Hermione’, and she’ll always regret that the last thing she did was slam the door— Oh, shut up. 812 SELF CE NTERE DNESS 813 815 CH APTER 51 816 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him, Professor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup placidly, as though nothing of special interest were occurring. Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his chair, already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest. The security precautions they were taking were literally the most stringent possible… “Are you ready to test it, Mr Potter?” Professor Quirrell said calmly. It wasn’t a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn’t say that, not out loud in human speech, even in this room screened to the limit that Professor Quirrell had secured with further Charms. “Yep,” Harry said as casually as he could. Step one. Harry said “Cloak” to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility, and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it toward the other side of the table. The Defence Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand, bent down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet in- cantation. The new enchantments would ensure that Professor Quirrell could enter the pouch on his own in snake form, and leave it on his own, and hear what went on outside while he was in the pouch. Step two. As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he’d bent over by the pouch, and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry’s direction, and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry’s chest near where the Time-Turner lay, like something creepy had passed very close by without touching him. Step three. The Defence Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense of doom diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the pouch’s mouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth closed again behind the tail, the sense of doom diminished further. Step four. Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it, so that the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor Quirrell had anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current orientation. “Wingardium Leviosa,” murmured Harry, and the pouch began to float toward him. Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch began to float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the pouch was open- ing, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm to propel it away from him as fast as possible. As the pouch came within a metre of Harry, the sense of doom re- turned. As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was stronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was tolera- ble. Even with Professor Quirrell’s Animagus form lying within the ex- tended space of the pouch resting on Harry’s very hip. Step five. Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of Invis- ibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself. Step six. And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which Pro- fessor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not until after Harry was wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility that he reached beneath his shirt and twisted the outer shell of the Time-Turner just once. The Time-Turner’s inner hourglass stayed anchored and motionless, the setting twisted around it— The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into place, the door sprang open. Mary’s Room was deserted, as it should have been, because Professor Quirrell had earlier contacted Mary’s Place under a false name to inquire whether the room would be available at this hour—not to reserve it, not to place a cancelled reservation that might be noted, but only to inquire. Step seven. Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the open door. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary’s Place to the well-stocked bar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner, Jake. There were only a few people at the bar in the late morning, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the door for several minutes, listening to the murmur of conversation and the gurgle of alcohol, before the door opened to emit a huge genial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silently in his wake. Step eight. Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary’s Place when he turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of which lay a shop that was dark, the windows enchanted to blackness. Step nine. “Sword fish melon friend,” Harry spoke the passphrase to the lock, and it clicked open. Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door briefly illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture shop which had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months ago, according to the Defence Professor, and the shop had been repossessed, but not yet resold. The walls were painted a simple white, the wooden floor scratched and unpolished, a single closed door set in the back wall; this had been a showroom, once, but now it showed nothing. The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was pitch and complete. Step ten. Harry took out his wand and said “Lumos”, lighting the room with white glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of doom growing a little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers) and lightly tossed it to the opposite side of the room (the sense of doom fading almost completely). And then he began to take off the Cloak of Invisibility, even as his voice hissed, “It iss done.” Step eleven. From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a metre-long green body as the snake slithered out. A moment later, the snake blurred into Professor Quirrell. Step twelve. Harry waited in silence while the Defence Professor recited thirty Charms. “All right,” Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had finished. “If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case doomed, so I will speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue does not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant of Salazar nor a true snake.” Harry nodded. “So, Mr Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his pale blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from Harry’s wand. “We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important question to ask you.” “Go ahead,” said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster. “What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?” That wasn’t quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was close enough, so Harry said, “Based on my limited knowledge, I would say that both the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be stupid, corrupt, and evil.” “Correct,” Professor Quirrell said. “Do you understand why I ask?” Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight in the eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way to make amazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the answer in ad- vance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago. It needed only a slight adjustment… “You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full of inter- esting people like yourself,” said Harry, “one of whose goals is to reform or overthrow the government of magical Britain, and yes, I’m in.” There was a slight pause. “I’m afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this conver- sation,” said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips were twitching slightly. “I merely planned to ask for your help in doing something extremely treasonous and illegal.” Darn, thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn’t denied it…“Go on.” “Before I do,” said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in his voice, now. “Are you open to such requests, Mr Potter? I say again that if you are likely to say no regardless, you must say no now. If your curiosity impels you otherwise, squash it.” “Treasonous and illegal doesn’t bother me,” said Harry. “Risks bother me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can’t imagine you taking risks frivolously.” Professor Quirrell nodded. “I would not. It is a terrible abuse of my friendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my teaching position at Hogwarts—” “You can skip this part,” Harry said. The lips twitched again, and then went flat. “Then I shall skip it. Mr Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths, playing with words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too, have been known to find that amusing. But if I so much as tell you what I hope we shall do this day, Mr Potter, you will lie about it. You will lie straight out, without hesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks about it, be they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to Granger, and to McGonagall. You will speak, always and without hesitation, in exactly the fashion you would speak if you knew nothing, with no concern for your honour. That also is how it must be.” There was silence, then, for a time. That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry’s soul. “Without telling me yet…” said Harry. “Can you say if the need is des- perate?” “There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,” Professor Quirrell said simply, “and there is no-one who can help them but you.” There was another silence, but not a long one. “All right,” Harry said quietly. “Tell me of the mission.” The dark robes of the Defence Professor seemed to blur against the shadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white light of Harry’s wand. “The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr Potter, wards off a De- mentor’s fear. But the Dementors still see you through it, they know that you are there. Only not your Patronus Charm. It blinds them, or more than blinds them. What I saw beneath the cloak wasn’t even looking in our direction as you killed it; as though it had forgotten our existence, even as it died.” Harry nodded. That wasn’t surprising, not when you confronted a Dementor on the level of its true existence, beyond anthropomorphism. Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn’t a sentient enemy. When humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox hadn’t fought back. “Mr Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every spell high and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have been suc- cessfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can undo. And yet no-one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No-one. For every Charm there is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a bypass. How can it be that no-one has ever been rescued from Azkaban?” “Because Azkaban has something invincible,” Harry said. “Something so terrible that no-one can defeat it.” That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be, nothing human. It was Death that guarded Azkaban. “The Dementors don’t like their meals being taken away from them,” Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice, now. “They know if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred Dementors there, and they speak to the guards as well. It’s that simple, Mr Potter. If you’re a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn’t hard to enter, and it isn’t hard to leave. So long as you don’t try to take anything out of it that belongs to the Dementors.” “But the Dementors are not invincible,” said Harry. He could have cast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very moment. “Never be- lieve that they are.” Professor Quirrell’s voice was very quiet. “Do you remember what it was like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when you failed?” “I remember.” And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry knew where this was going; he should have seen it before. “There is an innocent person in Azkaban,” Professor Quirrell said. Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but he didn’t cry. “The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse,” said the Defence Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater shadow. “There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if you have the time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of which I will not speak. I cannot tell you how I know this, how I know any of this, cannot hint at it even to you, you will have to trust me. But there is a person in Azkaban who never once chose to serve the Dark Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the most terrible cold and darkness imaginable, and never deserved a single minute of it.” Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing almost ahead of his thoughts. There was no hint, no warning, we all thought— “A person by the name of Black,” Harry said. There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at him. “Well,” said Professor Quirrell after a while. “So much for not telling you the name until after you had accepted the mission. I would ask whether you’re reading my mind, but that’s flatly impossible.” Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you believed in the pro- cesses of modern democracy. The most obvious person in Azkaban to be innocent was the one who hadn’t had a trial— “I am certainly impressed, Mr Potter,” said Professor Quirrell. His face was grave. “But this is a serious matter, and if there is some way others could make the same deduction, I must know. So tell me, Mr Potter. How in the name of Merlin, of Atlantis, and the void between the stars, did you guess that I was talking about Bellatrix?” CHAPTER FIFT Y-TWO THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, PART II The adrenaline was already flowing in Harry’s veins, his heart already hammering in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt store. Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand, Harry held a tiny wooden twig that would be the key. This was it, this was the day and the moment when Harry started acting the part. His first true adventure, a dungeon to be pierced, an evil government to be defied, a maiden in distress to be rescued. Harry should have been more frightened, more reluctant, but instead he felt only that it was time and past time to start becoming the people he had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward what he had always known he was meant to be, a hero. To take the first step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and Captain Picard and Liono of Thundera and definitely not Raistlin Majere. So far as Harry’s brain knew from watching early morning cartoons, when you grew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers and save the universe, that was what Harry’s brain had seen adults doing and adopted as its role model for the maturation process, and Harry very much wanted to start growing up. And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some part of his innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then for now, at least, in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time and past time for him to experience that pain. Like casting off clothes too small for him; or like fi- nally advancing to the next stage of the game, after being stuck for eleven years on world 3, level 2 of Super Mario Brothers. Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn’t feel this en- thusiastic afterwards, so he was enjoying it while it lasted. There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared, and then there was no more time for heroic brooding. Harry’s hand snapped the small wooden twig. A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry’s abdomen as the portkey acti- vated, feeling like a much harder pull this time than the smaller transports between the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley— —and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder dying away, and a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face, the water coat- ing Harry’s glasses and blinding him in an instant, turning the world into a blur even as he began to fall toward the raging ocean waves far below. He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea. The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of the broomstick that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not have been a good idea. It took nearly a full second for Harry to get his wits together and bring his broomstick back up in an easy swoop. “I’m here,” said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air above him; low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded man Professor Quirrell had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning himself and his broom- stick. “I’m here,” Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility. He hadn’t used Polyjuice himself. Wearing a different body hindered your magic, and Harry might need all of his little magic about him; thus the plan called for Harry to stay invisible at nearly all times, instead of Polyjuicing. (Neither of them had spoken the other’s name. You simply didn’t use your names at any point during an illegal mission, even invisibly hovering over an anonymous patch of water in the North Sea. You simply didn’t. It would be stupid.) Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while the rain and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an equally careful grip and Imperviused his glasses. Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around. He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five degrees Celsius if he was lucky; he’d already had a Warming Charm cast on him- self just from being outside in February, but it wasn’t standing up to the driving cold droplets. Worse than snow, the rain soaked into every ex- posed surface. The Cloak of Invisibility turned all of you invisible, but it didn’t cover all of you, and that meant it didn’t protect all of you from rain. Harry’s face was exposed to the full force of the driven water, and it was driving straight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, also the sleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his trousers and his shoes, the water took every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in. “This way,” said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green light lit up in front of Harry’s broomstick, and then darted away in a direction that seemed to Harry like every other direction. Through the blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost it sometimes, that small green spark, and each time he did, Harry called out, and the spark would reappear in front of him a few seconds later. When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it acceler- ated, and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and followed. The rain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined it must feel to get a faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses stayed clear and protected his eyes. It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick’s full speed, that Harry caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain, towering far across the waters. And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from where Death waited, washing over Harry’s mind and parting around it, like a wave breaking on stone. Harry knew his enemy this time, and his will was steel and all of the light. “I can already feel the Dementors,” said the gravelly voice of the Polyjuiced Quirrell. “I did not expect that, not this soon.” “Think of the stars,” Harry said, over a distant rumble of thunder. “Don’t allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just think of the stars, what it feels like to forget yourself and fall bodilessly through space. Hold to that thought like an Occlumency barrier across your entire mind. The Dementors will have some trouble reaching past that.” There was silence for a moment, then, “Interesting.” The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick slightly up- ward to follow, even as it steered them into a fog bank, a cloud hovering low on the waters. Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge three- sided metal building, as it loomed far below. The triangle of steel was hol- low, not solid, it was a building of three thick solid walls and no centre. The Aurors on guard slept in the top level and southern side of the build- ing, Professor Quirrell had said, protected by their Patronus Charms. The legal entrance into Azkaban was on the roof of the south-west corner of the building. Which the two of them wouldn’t use, of course. Instead they would use a corridor that ran directly beneath the northern corner of the building. Professor Quirrell would go down first, and puncture a hole in the roof and its wards right at the northern tip, leaving behind an illusion to cover the gap. The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels corre- sponding to their crimes. And at the bottom, in the uttermost centre and depth of Azkaban, lay a nest of more than a hundred Dementors. Loads of dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up the level, as the matter di- rectly exposed to the Dementors broke down into mud and nothingness… “Wait one minute,” said the rough voice, “follow me at speed, and pass through with care.” “Got it,” Harry said quietly. The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand… …sixty one thousand, and Harry dived, the wind shrieking around him as he dived, down toward the vast metal structure, down toward where he could feel the shadows of Death waiting for him, draining light and radiating emptiness, as the metal structure grew larger and larger. Plain and featureless loomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised boxlike structure in the south-west corner. The north corner was simply blank, Professor Quirrell’s hole undetectable. Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner, giving himself more safety margin than he would have bothered with in flying classes, but not too much. As soon as he’d come to a halt, he began to slowly lower his broomstick again, toward what looked like the solid roof of the tip of the north corner. Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a strange ex- perience, and then Harry found himself in a metal corridor lighted with a dim orange light—which, Harry realized after a startled glance, was com- ing from an old-fashioned mantled gas lamp… …for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the presence of Dementors. Harry dismounted his broom. The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and flowed around Harry without touching him. They were distant but they were many, the wounds in the world; Harry could have pointed to them with his eyes closed. “Casst your Patronuss,” hissed a snake from the floor, looking more dis- coloured than green in the dim orange light. The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue. Harry was sur- prised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their Animagus forms were much less vulnerable to Dementors. (For the same reason that Pa- tronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If Professor Quirrell was in this much trouble in his snake form, what had been happening to him while he was in the human form that let him use his magic…? Harry’s wand was already rising in his hand. This would be the beginning. Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could save from the darkness, even if he wasn’t powerful enough yet to teleport all of Azk- aban’s prisoners to safety and burn the triangular hell down to bedrock… Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down payment on everything that Harry meant to accomplish with his life. No more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would all begin here. Here and now. Harry’s wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waited far below. “Expecto Patronum!” The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence. It wasn’t the sun-bright thing that it had been before…probably because Harry hadn’t quite been able to stop himself from thinking about all the other prisoners in their cells, the ones that he wasn’t here to save. It might be for the best, though. Harry would need to keep this Pa- tronus going for a while, and it might be better if it wasn’t quite so bright. The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then further again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength into it, until finally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing only slightly brighter than the brightest animal Patronus, and Harry felt that he could dim it no further without risking losing it entirely. And then, “It iss sstable,” Harry hissed, and began feeding his broom- stick into his pouch. His wand stayed in his hand, and a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced the slight losses from his Patronus. The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding Profes- sor Quirrell’s wand in one hand and a broomstick in the other. The lanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and went to lean against the wall for a moment. “Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow,” murmured the gravelly voice. Pro- fessor Quirrell’s dryness was in it, even though it didn’t fit the voice, nor did the grave look on the thickly bearded face. “I cannot feel them at all, now.” A moment later, the broomstick went into the man’s robes and van- ished. Then the man’s wand rose and tapped on his head, and with a sound like a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more. Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still en- shrouded in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after. If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen nothing but a small green spark drifting through the air, and a brilliantly silver humanoid walking after it. 830 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT II 831 CH APTER 52 832 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT II After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor that did not end in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green spark halted before it. Harry’s heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into the depths of Azkaban without anything happening. But now it was hammering his chest once more. They were at the bottom, and the shadows of Death were very close at hand. A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell opened the way. Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that Professor Quirrell had told him. The hard part wouldn’t just be getting the pre- tended personality right enough to fool Bellatrix Black herself, the hard part would be keeping his Patronus going at the same time… The green spark winked out, and a moment later a metre-high snake shimmered into existence, no longer invisible. The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushed on it with his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered through. He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone. There was no light there but what crept in from Harry’s Patronus. That was bright enough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells set into the corridor, but he couldn’t see the insides; more importantly, though, he didn’t see anyone in the corridor itself. “I ssee nothing,” hissed Harry. The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the floor. A moment later— “She iss alone,” hissed the snake. Stay, Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a position just to one side of the door, as though guarding it; and then Harry pushed the door open further, and followed within. The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse, skin gone grey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose the bone be- neath, no eyes— Harry shut his eyes. He could still do that, he was still invisible, he wasn’t betraying anything by shutting his eyes. He’d known it already, he’d read it on page six of his Transfiguration book, that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison term was done. If you died before it was up they kept you there until they released your corpse. If your term was for life, they just left the body in the cell until the cell was needed, at which point they threw your body into the Dementors’ pit. But it was still a shock to see, that corpse had been a person who’d just been left there— The light in the room wavered. Steady, thought Harry in his core. It wouldn’t be good for Professor Quirrell if that Patronus went out from his thinking sad thoughts. This near to the Dementors the Defence Professor might just fall dead where he stood. Steady, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, steady! With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn’t time to waste. The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton. And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix Black. Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like dry grass. You could tell the woman wasn’t a skeleton, that her head wasn’t a skull, because the texture of skin was still different from the texture of bone, no matter how white and pale she’d become, waiting in the dark alone. Either they weren’t feeding her much, or what she ate, the shadows of Death drained from her; for her eyes seemed shrunken below their lids, her lips looked too shrivelled to close over her teeth. The colour seemed leached out of the black clothing she had worn into prison, like the De- mentors had drained that too. They’d been meant to be daring, those clothes, and now they lay loosely over a skeleton, exposing shrivelled skin. I’m here to save her, I’m here to save her, I’m here to save her, Harry thought to himself, desperately, over and over with an effort like Occlumency, willing his Patronus not to go out, to stay and protect Bellatrix from the Dementors— In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his compas- sion, his will to save her from the darkness; the silver radiance coming in through the open door brightened, even as he thought it. And in another part of him, like he was just letting another part of his mind carry out a habit without paying much attention to it… A cold expression came over Harry’s face, invisibly beneath the hood. “Hello, my dear Bella,” said a chill whisper. “Did you miss me?” CHAPTER FIFT Y-THREE THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, PART III The corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbs gazed out at nothing. “Mad,” Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, “It seems that little Bella is going mad…” Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely, how he was to act in Bellatrix’s presence; how to form the pretence he would main- tain in his mind. You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make Bellatrix fall in love with you, to bind her to your service. That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor Quirrell had said, because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy thought. She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You do not return her love, but consider her useful. She knows this. She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called her your dear Bella. Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his parents: the cold amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that high-pitched voice of deathly hate. It didn’t seem at all difficult to guess what the Dark Lord would say. “I hope you are not mad, Bella dear,” said the chill whisper. “Mad is not useful.” Bellatrix’s eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air. “My…Lord…I waited for you but you did not come…I looked for you but I could not find you…you are alive…” All her words came out in a low mutter, if there was emotion in it, Harry could not tell. “Show her your face,” hissed the snake at Harry’s feet. Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility. The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial expres- sions looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity, only cool, calm interest. (While in his core, Harry thought, I will save you, I will save you no matter what…) “The scar…” muttered Bellatrix. “That child…” “So they all still think,” said Harry’s voice, and gave a thin little chuckle. “You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella dear.” (Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn’t be the one to play the part of the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed out that there was no plausible reason for him to be possessed by the shade of He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named.) Bellatrix’s eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word. “Say ssomething in Parsseltongue,” hissed the snake. Harry’s face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was address- ing it, and hissed, “One two three four five ssix sseven eight nine ten.” There was a pause. “Those who do not fear the darkness…” murmured Bellatrix. The snake hissed, “Will be conssumed by it.” “Will be consumed by it,” whispered the chill voice. Harry didn’t partic- ularly want to think about how Professor Quirrell had obtained that pass- word. His brain, which thought about it anyway, suggested that it had probably involved a Death Eater, a quiet isolated place, and some lead- pipe Legilimency. “Your wand,” murmured Bellatrix, “I took it from the Potters’ house and hid it, my lord…under the tombstone to the right of your father’s grave…will you kill me, now, if that was all you wished of me…I think I must have always wanted you to be the one to kill me…but I can’t remember now, it must have been a happy thought…” Harry’s heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and—and he couldn’t cry, couldn’t let his Patronus fade— Harry’s face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was sharp as it said, “Enough foolishness. You’re to come with me, Bella dear, unless you prefer the company of the Dementors.” Bellatrix’s face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken limbs did not stir. “You'll need to float her out,” Harry hissed to the snake. “She can no longer think of esscaping.” “Yess,” hissed the snake, “but do not underesstimate her, sshe wass the dead- liesst of warriorss.” The green head dipped in warning. “One would be wisse to fear me, boy, even were I sstarved and nine-tenthss dead; be wary of her, allow no ssingle flaw in your pretence.” The green snake smoothly glided out of the door. And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful expression on his bearded face cringed into the room with his wand in hand. “My Lord?” the servant said falteringly. “Do as you were instructed,” the Dark Lord whispered in that chill voice, sounding even more terrible coming from a child’s body. “And do not let your Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not return there will be no reward for you, and it will be long before your family is allowed to die.” Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his invisi- bility cloak over his head, and disappeared. The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix’s cage, and pulled a tiny needle from his robes with which he poked the human skeleton. The single drop of red blood produced was soon absorbed into a small doll, which was laid upon the floor, and the servant began to chant in a whisper. Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless. After- wards the servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from the empty air hissed an impatient command. Then the servant pointed his wand at Bellatrix and spoke a word, and the living skeleton lying on the bed was naked, and the skeleton lying on the floor was clothed in her faded dress. The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it lay upon the seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful man then produced an empty glass flask with small traces of golden fluid clinging to its in- side. This flask was concealed in a corner, the strip of skirt laid over it, the leached cloth nearly blending with the grey metal wall. Another wave of the servant’s wand floated the human skeleton lying on the bed into the air, and in almost the same motion clothed her in new black robes. An ordinary-looking bottle of chocolate milk was put into her hand, and a chill whisper ordered Bellatrix to grasp the bottle and begin drinking it, which she did, her face still looking only puzzled. Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself invisi- ble, and they left. The door closed behind them all and clicked as it locked, plunging the corridor into darkness once more, unchanged but for a small flask concealed in the corner of one cell, and a fresh corpse lying upon its floor. 840 841 CH APTER 5 4 842 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I V 843 CH APTER 5 4 844 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I V In the Auror’s quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio was snor- ing in the barracks, one was resting in the break room, and one was on duty in the command room, keeping watch. The room was simple but large, with three chairs at the back where the Aurors sat, their wands al- ways in hand to sustain their three Patronuses, as the bright white forms paced in front of the open window, sheltering them all from the Demen- tors’ fear. The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker, and didn’t look out the window. You could have seen some sky there, sure, and there was even an hour or two every day where you could’ve seen some sun, but that window also looked down on the central pit of hell. Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you. There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty here, triple pay or no triple pay, if he hadn’t had a family to support. (His real name was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike instead; he’d named his children Su and Kao, which hopefully would serve them better.) His only consolation, besides the money, was that at least his mates played an excellent game of Dragon Poker. Though it would be hard not to, at this point. It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his best hand of the 5,300s. It was a Saturday in February and there were three players, which let him shift the suit of any one hole card except a two, three, or seven; and that was enough to let him build a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons, and sevens… Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the table cards toward the direction of the window, staring. The sinking feeling came over Li’s stomach with surprising speed. If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned into a six, he was going straight down to two pair and McCusker might beat that— “Mike,” said McCusker, “what’s with your Patronus?” Li turned his head and looked. His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the pit and was staring downward at something only it could see. A moment later, Bahry’s moonlit duck and McCusker’s bright anteater followed suit, staring in the same downward direction. They all exchanged glances, and then sighed. “I’ll tell them,” said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the three Aurors who were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate anything anomalous. “Maybe relieve one of them and take the C spiral, if you two don’t mind.” Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. It wasn’t too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough to hire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit someone who could cast the Patronus Charm. People with friends in Azkaban would do that, break in just to give someone a half-day’s worth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead of nightmares. Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their cell, to increase the chance they lived through their sentence. And the Aurors on guard…well, even if you got caught, you could probably convince the Aurors to overlook it, in exchange for the right bribe. For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts and a silver Sickle. He hated this place. But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer’s bills, and if you could afford to hire someone who could break into Azkaban, then you could afford to grease Bahry’s remaining palm pretty hard, if he was the one who caught you. By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by being the first to propose it, the three of them finished out their poker hand first. Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up. And by then the Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to their normal patrol, so it was probably nothing, but procedure was procedure. After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and stood up from the table. The older man’s long white locks brushed against his fancy red robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of the command room, as Bahry went through the separating door that led to the formerly off- duty Aurors. Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a little queasy about this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them all the pictures, and you had to let a man do what he could for his poor sick wife, especially when he only had seven months left before his retirement. 847 CH APTER 5 4 848 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I V 849 CH APTER 5 4 Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine. The man’s wand had moved so fast that it was like it had Apparated into place, and Bahry’s stunner was currently sparkling tamely at the end of it, not blocked, not countered, not deflected, caught like a fly in honey. “My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons,” said the man in a colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile looked wrong on that bearded face. “And you shall need to accept a Memory Charm.” Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that his own stunner couldn’t pass back through, already tilted his wand back into a defensive position, already raised his hardened artificial hand into posi- tion to block anything blockable, and was already thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields— The man wasn’t looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously at Bahry’s stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand, drawing out red sparks and flicking them away with his fingers, slowly disassembling the hex like a child’s rod puzzle. The man hadn’t raised any shields of his own. “Tell me,” the man said in a disinterested voice that didn’t seem to quite fit the rough throat—Polyjuice, Bahry would have called it, if he’d thought that anyone could possibly do magic that delicate from inside someone else’s body—“what did you do in the last war? Put yourself in harm’s way, or stay out of trouble?” “Harm’s way,” said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an Auror with nearly a hundred full years on the force, seven months short of mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody couldn’t have said it with any more hardness. “Fight any Death Eaters?” Now a grim smile graced Bahry’s own face. “Two at once.” Two of You- Know-Who’s own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their dark master. Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had been the toughest fight of Bahry’s life, but he’d stood his ground, and walked away with only the loss of his left hand. “Did you kill them?” The man sounded idly curious, and he continued to draw threads of fire out of the much-diminished stun bolt still captive on the end of his wand, his fingers now weaving small patterns of Bahry’s own magic before flicking to disperse them. Sweat broke out on Bahry’s skin beneath his robes. His metal hand flashed downward, ripped the mirror from his belt—“Bahry to Mike, I need backup!” There was a pause, and silence. “Bahry to Mike!” The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put it back on his belt. “It’s been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a serious oppo- nent,” the man said, still not looking up at Bahry. “Try not to disappoint me too much. You can attack whenever you’re ready. Or you can walk away with five hundred Galleons.” There was a long silence. Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed his wand downward. 851 CH APTER 5 4 852 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I V Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was going to make it— His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death, so Bahry only briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette, the Patronus brighter than any he’d ever seen, saw it just barely long enough to recog- nize the impossible shape, before the green and the silver light collided and both lights vanished, both lights vanished, the Killing Curse had been blocked, and then Bahry’s ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent screaming, screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and screaming, starting to fall as Bahry was already falling— Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and his dis- located left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest. Bahry ignored the pain, managed to scramble back to his knees, brought up his wand to stun his opponent, he didn’t understand what was happening but he knew that this was his only chance. “Stupefy!” The red bolt struck out toward the man’s falling body, and was torn apart in mid-air and dissipated—and not by any shield. Bahry could see it, the wavering in the air that surrounded his fallen and screaming oppo- nent. Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux of magic building and building and building toward some terrible breaking point. His instincts screamed at him to run before the explosion came, this was no Charm, no Curse, this was wizardry run wild, but before Bahry could even finish getting to his feet— The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away his wand!) and a second later, his form blurred and vanished entirely. A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even before Bahry’s next stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without resistance. As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the wild wiz- ardry died back down, Bahry’s dazed mind noticed that the scream was continuing. Only it sounded different, like the scream of a young boy, coming from the stairs leading down to the next lower level. That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except for Bahry’s frantic panting. His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent had been insanely powerful, that hadn’t been a duel, it had been like his first year as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam Tarma. The Death Eaters hadn’t been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye Moody wasn’t that good…and who, what, how in the name of Merlin’s balls had anyone blocked a Killing Curse? Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his rib, mutter the healing spell, and then press it again to his shoulder. It took more out of him than it should have, took far too much out of him, his magic was within a bare breath of utter exhaustion; he didn’t have any- thing left for his minor cuts and bruises or even to reinforce the scraps left of his shielding. It was all he could do not to let his Patronus go out. Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as he could before he spoke. “You,” Bahry said. “Whoever you are. Come out.” There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was might be unconscious. He didn’t understand what had just happened, but he’d heard the scream… Well, there was one way to test that. “Come out,” said Bahry, making his voice harder, “or I start using area- effect curses.” He probably couldn’t have managed one if he’d tried. “Wait,” said a boy’s voice, a young boy’s voice, high and thin and wa- vering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or tears. The voice now seemed to be coming from closer to hand. “Please wait. I’m—coming out—” “Drop the invisibility,” growled Bahry. He was too tired to bother with anti-Disillusionment Charms. A moment later, a young boy’s face emerged from within an unfolding invisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the green eyes, the glasses, and the angry red lightning-bolt scar. If he’d had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he might have blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably shouldn’t say in front of the Boy-Who-Lived. “He, he,” the boy’s wavering voice said, his young face looked fright- ened and exhausted and tears were still trickling down his cheeks, “he kidnapped me, to make me cast my Patronus…he said he’d kill me if I didn’t…only I couldn’t let him just kill you…” Bahry’s mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to click into place. Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse. Bahry might have been able to dodge the green death, he’d certainly been trying, but if the matter came up before the Wizengamot, they’d rule it was a life- debt to a Noble House. “I see,” Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk toward the boy. “Son, I’m sorry for what you’ve been through, but I need you to drop the cloak and drop your wand.” The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the sweat- soaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand clutching an eleven-inch holly wand so hard his knuckles were white. “Your wand,” Bahry repeated. “Sorry,” whispered the eleven-year-old boy, “here,” and he held out the wand toward Bahry. Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized boy who’d just saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with a sigh, and just stretched out a hand to take the wand. “Look, son, you’re really not supposed to point a wand at—” The wand’s end twisted lightly beneath Bahry’s hand just as the boy whispered, “Somnium.” 856 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT I V Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around the table, and so they both saw it at the same time, the naked, skeletally thin horror rising up to hover outside the window, the headache already hit- ting them from seeing it. They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken words and those words themselves had aged and died. The Dementor’s speech hurt their ears as it said, “Bellatrix Black is out of her cell.” There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore out of his chair, heading for the communicator to call in reinforcements from the Ministry, even as McCusker grabbed his mirror and started frantically trying to raise the three Aurors who’d gone on patrol. CHAPTER FIFT Y-FI V E THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, PART V In a scarred and ruined corridor, lit by dim gas lights, a boy slowly crept forward, one hand stretched out, toward the unmoving snake that was the body of his teacher. Harry was only a metre away from the snake’s body when he first felt it, tickling at the edge of his perception. Ever so weakly, a sense of doom… Professor Quirrell was alive, then. The thought engendered no feeling of joy, only a sort of empty despair. Harry would still be caught soon, and no matter how he tried to ex- plain, it still wouldn’t look good. No-one would trust him again, they would think he was the next Dark Lord, they wouldn’t help him when it came time to fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give up on him, probably even Dumbledore would look for another hero… …maybe they’d just send him home to his parents. He had failed. Harry looked at the crumpled body of the police officer he’d stunned, the already-drying blood from the minor cuts and slashes, the burned places on the intricately embroidered red robes. He’d been stupid. He shouldn’t have stunned the police officer, should have just stayed with his original story about being kidnapped by Professor Quirrell… It might not be too late, whispered a voice inside him. You might still be able to fix your mistake. The Auror saw you, he remembers that you stunned him… but if he were dead, if Professor Quirrell were dead, if Bellatrix were dead, there would be no-one to contradict your story. Slowly, Harry’s hand started to rise, pointing his wand at the police officer and— Harry’s hand halted. He had a distant sense he was behaving uncharacteristically of him- self, somehow. Like there was something he’d forgotten, something im- portant, but he was having trouble remembering what it was, exactly. Oh. That was right. He was someone who believed in the value of hu- man life. A sense of puzzlement accompanied the thought, he couldn’t quite remember why other people’s lives had seemed valuable… All right, said the logical part of him, why has my mind changed between then and now? Because he was in Azkaban… And he’d forgotten to recast the Patronus Charm… Doing anything at all, somehow, seemed like a tremendous effort, like the thought of action itself was a weight too heavy to lift; but it did seem like a good idea to recast the Patronus Charm, for he was still able to be afraid of Dementors. And though he couldn’t remember what it was like to be happy, he knew that this wasn’t it. Harry’s hand rose to hold his wand level before him, his fingers took the starting positions. And then Harry paused. He couldn’t…quite remember…what he’d used as his happy thought. That was odd, it had been something very important, he really ought to be able to remember it…something to do with death? But that wasn’t happy… His body was shivering, Azkaban hadn’t seemed so cold before, and it seemed to be getting colder even as he thought. It was too late for him, he’d already sunk too far, he’d never be able to cast the Patronus Charm now— That may be the Dementation talking rather than an accurate estimate, ob- served the logical part of himself, habits that had been encoded into sheer reflex, requiring no energy to activate. Think of the Dementors’ fear as a cog- nitive bias, and try to overcome it the way you would overcome any other cognitive bias. Your hopeless feelings may not indicate that the situation is actually hopeless. It may only indicate that you are in the presence of Dementors. All negative emo- tions and pessimistic estimates must now be considered suspect, fallacious until proven valid. (If you’d been watching the boy as he thought, you would have seen a distant, abstract, puzzled frown move across his face, below the glasses and the lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed in the starting position for the Patronus Charm, and did not move.) The presence of Dementors interferes with the part of you that processes happi- ness. If you cannot retrieve your happy thought by mnemonic association on the key of happiness, perhaps you can get at the memory some other way instead. When was the last time you talked to someone about the Patronus Charm? Harry couldn’t seem to remember that either. A crushing wave of despair swept over him, and was dismissed by the logical part of himself as untrustworthy, external, not-Harry, the dull weight still pressed him down but his mind went on thinking, it didn’t take much effort to think… When was the last time you talked to someone about Dementors? Professor Quirrell had said that he was already able to feel the pres- ence of Dementors, and Harry had said to Professor Quirrell…he’d told Professor Quirrell… …to hold to the memory of the stars, of falling bodilessly through space, like an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind. His second Defence class of the year, on Friday, that was when Profes- sor Quirrell had shown him the stars, and again on Christmas. It didn’t take much effort to remember them, the searing points of white against perfect blackness. Harry remembered the great cloudy wash of the Milky Way. Harry remembered the peace. Some of the coldness at the fringes of his limbs seemed to retreat. There were words he had spoken out loud on the day he’d first cast the Patronus Charm, his mind could remember the sounds and the speech even as the feelings seemed distant… …I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the natural order. You cast the True Patronus Charm by thinking about the value of hu- man life. …But there are other lives that are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and my life, and Hermione Granger’s life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond, to be defended and protected. Then the idea of killing everyone…that hadn’t been his true self, that had been the Dementation talking… Despair was the Dementors’ influence. Where there’s life, there’s hope. The Auror is still alive. Professor Quirrell is still alive. Bellatrix is still alive. I’m still alive. No-one’s actually died yet… Harry could picture the Earth, now, in the midst of the star-field, the blue-white orb. …and I won’t let them! “Expecto Patronum!” The words came out a little halting, and when the human shape burst back into existence it was dim at first, moonlight instead of sunlight, white instead of silver. But it strengthened, slowly, as Harry breathed in deliberate rhythm, recovering. Letting the light drive back the darkness from his mind. Re- membering the things that he had almost forgotten, and channelling them back into the Patronus Charm. Even when the light blazed full and silver once more, illuminating the corridor more brightly than the gas lamps, banishing fully the cold, Harry’s limbs still shook. That had been too close. Harry took a deep breath. All right. It was time to reconsider the situ- ation now that his thoughts were no longer being artificially darkened by Dementors. Harry reviewed the situation. …still looked pretty hopeless, actually. It wasn’t the crushing despair of before, but Harry still felt wobbly, to put it mildly. He didn’t dare go dark and it was his dark side that had the ability to take this level of problem in stride. It was his dark side that would have laughed scornfully at the very concept of giving up just be- cause he’d lost Professor Quirrell and was marooned in the depths of Azk- aban and had been seen by a police officer. The ordinary Harry was not able to take that sort of thing in stride. But there wasn’t any option except to keep moving forward anyway. You couldn’t get any more pointless than giving up before you’d actually lost. Harry looked around. Dim gas lights lit a corridor of grey metal, whose sides and floor and ceiling were slashed in places, gouged and melted, telling anyone who cared to look that there had been battle here. Professor Quirrell could have repaired it easily enough, if he’d… The sense of betrayal struck Harry with full force, then. Why…why did he…why… Because he’s evil, said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, quietly and sadly. We told you so. No! thought Harry desperately. No, it doesn’t make sense, we were going to commit the perfect crime, the Auror could have been Obliviated, the corridor re- paired, it wasn’t too late but it would have been too late if he’d died! But Professor Quirrell was never really planning to commit the perfect crime, said the grim voice of Slytherin. He wanted the crime to be noticed. He wanted everyone to know that someone had killed an Auror and broken Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban. He would have prepared some kind of evidence, some proof he could reveal of your involvement, to use as blackmail against you; and you would have been bound to him forever. Harry’s Patronus almost went out, then. No… Harry thought. Yes, said the other three parts of him sadly. No. It still doesn’t make sense. Professor Quirrell had to know I would turn against him the instant I saw him kill an Auror. That I might very well go ahead and confess to Dumbledore, hoping to plead the true fact that I was tricked. And… in terms of blackmail, does his killing an Auror against my will, really add all that much to breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban with my willing help? It would have been more cunning to keep the evidence of my involvement with the basic crime, but still pretend to be my ally for as long as he could, saving the blackmail to use only if it became necessary… Rationalization, said Slytherin. So why did Professor Quirrell do it, then? And Harry thought with a tinge of desperation—knowing, even as he thought it, that he was motivated in part by a desire to reject reality, and that wasn’t how the technique was meant to be wielded—I notice that I am confused. There was internal silence. None of the parts of himself seemed to have anything to add to that. And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately hopeless-looking situation. Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was evil? …not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a given that Bellatrix was currently evil. Whether she was an innocent who’d been made that way by torture and Legilimency and unspeakable rituals, or whether she’d chosen it of her own will, didn’t have much bearing on the current situation. The key fact was that while Bellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord, she would obey him. That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and nine- tenths dead… ‘Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange…’ Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry’s Patronus had blazed out of control. Harry thought, and he couldn’t have quite said why he thought this, it might have just been his own mind making things up, but…it seemed likely that what the Dementors had taken from you long ago was lost for- ever. But what the Dementors had taken from you recently, the True Pa- tronus Charm might give back. Like the difference between emptying a cup, and the unused cup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have got back what she’d lost in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories, those would have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magic had been drained from her in just the last week, she might have regained. Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to build up her magic again… Harry looked at Professor Quirrell’s snake form. …maybe enough for an Innervate. If awakening Professor Quirrell was, in fact, a smart thing to do. Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn’t trust Pro- fessor Quirrell, couldn’t trust that reviving him would be wise, not after what had just happened. Steady, Harry thought to himself, and looked at the crumpled form of the Auror. Bellatrix might also be able to manage a Memory Charm. That could be step one, anyway. It wasn’t exactly getting everyone safely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors would know afterwards that some- thing strange had happened, they might suspect Bellatrix’s body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step. …and would it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban? If they could get to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the Auror was supposed to report back in, before anyone noticed him missing, then they could just fly out through the hole Professor Quirrell had made, and get far enough away from Azkaban to activate the portkey Harry already had in his pos- session. (Both Professor Quirrell and Harry had portkeys, and both were powerful enough to transport two humans, plus or minus a snake. As with their doubly-concealed departure from Mary’s Room, Professor Quirrell had put enough safety margin in his plans to impress even Harry.) Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell’s snake form, which Harry dared not touch or levitate. Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was waiting on the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little. It was starting to look like a good plan, and there was no time to waste in going about it. What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter Bellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed to hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer…well, Harry could work that out along the way. Harry would probably have to bamboozle the healer into doing something—which was going to take one hell of a bamboozling, and Harry wasn’t even sure what he wanted done—but he and Bellatrix had to get moving now. The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process for- ward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof. Profes- sor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and Confund the monitors that would notice visitors in the ærial surroundings of Azk- aban, causing them to see a repeating loop of scenery for a few minutes. Professor Quirrell had said that he couldn’t Disillusion Harry’s Patronus; and if they switched off the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bella- trix was missing, and alert the Aurors… Harry’s train of thought stumbled. There were times when ‘Aw, crap’ just didn’t seem to cover it. 866 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting motionless on the stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and when Harry asked in a cold, high whisper whether she was awake, he got no response. A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that Professor Quirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing the Dark Lord’s cringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened criminal and then an expert battle-mage. Which was good, because she wouldn’t have heard Harry’s voice saying ‘Expecto Patronum’. Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at Bellatrix, and whispered as gently as he could, “Innervate.” From the way Bellatrix’s body jerked a little, Harry didn’t think he’d managed to get it quite gentle enough. The sunken dark eyes opened. “Bella dear,” Harry said in his cold, high voice, “I am afraid we’ve run into a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do small magics?” There was a pause, and then Bellatrix’s pale head nodded. “Very good,” Harry said dryly. “I won’t ask you to walk unaided, Bella dear, but I am afraid you must walk.” He pointed his wand at her. “Wingardium Leviosa.” Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain for a while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her current body weight. She was…thin. Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black pushed herself to her feet. Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix slowly leaned down, took Professor Quirrell’s wand (which Harry dared not touch), and slowly straightened again. Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her voice pre- cise though it was still a whisper, “Innervate.” The snake did not stir. “Shall I try again, my Lord?” she whispered. “No,” Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had decided to say the hell with it and try to revive Professor Quirrell after he’d real- ized that the Dementors had probably alerted the Aurors by now. His high, cold voice went on, unperturbed, “Do you think you are able to perform a Memory Charm, dear Bella?” Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, “I think so, my Lord.” “Eliminate that Auror’s last half-hour of memory,” Harry commanded. He’d thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide any justification for that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked why they weren’t just killing him, in which case Harry would explain that they were pretending to be a different power group and then tell her to shut up— But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood silently for a time, and finally whispered, “Obliviate.” She swayed, then, but did not fall. “Very good, my dear Bella,” Harry said, and chuckled thinly. “And I will ask you to carry that snake.” Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn’t ask why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn’t do it. She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent over, picked it up, draped it over her shoulder. (A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very relaxing to have a minion that would just follow orders so unquestioningly, and even got as far as thinking that he could totally get used to having a minion like Bella- trix, before that mind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortally offended remainder.) “Follow,” the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk. 869 CH APTER 5 5 870 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor, invisible be- side Bellatrix and the silver shape following them, trying to think of a better plan. At first, when he’d realized that the Aurors probably knew already, and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn’t waking up… His thoughts had frozen up there, for a second. And then stayed frozen, even as he’d started heading downward with Bellatrix, to buy as much time as possible; the Aurors, Harry figured, would start at the top and move down level by level. The Aurors could afford to move slowly and securely; they knew their prey had no way out. Harry hadn’t been able to think of any way out. Until Harry had said to himself, well, if it was just a war game, what would General Chaos do? From which an answer had followed instantly. And then Harry had thought, but if it’s that easy, why hasn’t anyone broken out of Azkaban before? And after he’d realized the possible problem: Fine, what would General Chaos do about that? Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to his first plan. It was… It was the most insanely Gryffindor thing Harry had ever… So now he was trying to think of a better plan, and not having much luck. Picky picky picky, said Gryffindor. Who was complaining about not having any plan one minute earlier? You should be glad we came up with anything at all, Mister Now-We’re-Doomed. “My Lord,” Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the next flight of stairs downward, “am I going back to my cell, my Lord?” Harry’s brain was distracted, so it took him that long to process the words, and then another moment to process the horror, while Bellatrix continued speaking. “I would…please, my Lord, I would very much rather die,” her voice said. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely there, “but I will go back if you ask it of me, my Lord…” “We are not going back to your cell,” hissed Harry’s voice, on auto- matic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his face. Um… said Hufflepuff. Did you seriously just think, ‘You ought to work for me, I would appreciate you?’ A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty, Harry thought. Even if I’m only getting it by mistake, I can’t help but— She’s the Dark Lord’s loyal killer and torturer, and the supposed reason she’s loyal is because an innocent girl was broken into pieces and used as raw material to make her, said Hufflepuff. Did you forget? If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake, there’s a part of me that can’t help but feel something. The Dark Lord must have been…evil doesn’t seem like a strong enough word, he must have been empty…to not appreciate her loyalty, artificial or not. The better parts of Harry didn’t have much to say to that. And that was when Harry heard it. It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took forward. A woman’s voice, distant, indistinct. His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words. “…please don’t…” “…didn’t mean…” “…don’t die…” Then his brain knew who he was hearing, and in almost the same mo- ment, figured out what he was hearing. Because Professor Quirrell wasn’t there to keep the silence any more, and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent. Faint the woman’s voice, repeating: “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the emotion in the words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation of… “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” …the woman’s worst memory, rehearsing over and over again… “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” …the murder that had sent her to Azkaban… “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” …where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever she’d killed, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop. Though she must have been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount of life left in her voice. The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had passed those doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest sign of disturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive proof of evil, if Harry’s own lips hadn’t remained silent in the presence of Bellatrix, his breathing regular, while something inside him screamed and screamed and screamed. The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened, with every step Harry took forward. It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the stairs, she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust outside the Cloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close to the snake draped around her neck. There was a surprised look on her face, but she accepted it, and said nothing. It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn’t enough. Not when he saw the huge metal door in the centre of that level’s cor- ridor. Not when they came closer, and the woman’s voice fell silent, because there was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn’t reliving her worst memory any more. Good, said a voice inside him. That was step one. Harry’s steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal door. And… Now unlock the door— …Harry kept walking… What do you think you’re doing? Go back and get her out of there! …kept walking… Save her! What are you doing? She’s hurting you have to save her! The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, only two, plus or minus a snake. If they’d had Professor Quirrell’s portkey too…but they didn’t, Professor Quirrell’s human form was carrying that, there was no way to get it…Harry could only save one person today, and there was only one person on the lowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperate need… “DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door. “No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—” There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter. “Please,” sobbed the woman’s voice, “please, I can’t remember my chil- dren’s names any more—” “Sit down, Bella,” Harry’s voice said, somehow he kept his voice in a cold whisper, “I must deal with this,” the Hover Charm diminishing and switching off even as Bella obediently sat down, her skeletal form dark against the brightening air. I’ll die, thought Harry. The air went on brightening. After all, it wasn’t a certainty that Harry would die. It was just a probability of death, and weren’t some things worth a probability of dying? The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning to form around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming indistinct within the burning air, as Harry’s life went to feed the fire. If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they’ll know it was me, that I was the one who did this…I’ll lose my support, lose the war… Yeah? said the inner voice that was urging him on. After you destroy all the Dementors in Azkaban? I’d think that’d tend to prove your credentials as a Light Lord, actually, so save her save her you have to save her— The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate entity. The corridor couldn’t be seen. Harry’s own body was invisible within the Cloak. There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse of sil- ver light. Harry could feel the life leaving him, fuelling the spell; far away, he could feel the shadows of Death begin to fray. I meant to accomplish more with my life than this…I was going to fight the Dark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding and Muggle worlds… Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to one woman begging him for help, it wasn’t certain that Harry would ever do anything more important than this one thing, this one thing that he could do now and here. And with what might have been his last breath, Harry thought: There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans…if I’m going to do this, I should do it when I’m closer to the central pit, it will take less of my life that way, which increases the probability that I’ll survive to destroy other Dementors…even assuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there’s a right time and place to do this, it isn’t now and here, it isn’t now and here! What? said the other part of him indignantly, as it searched for a coun- terargument that didn’t exist— Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that one indisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren’t in the optimal place, the time couldn’t be now… Slowly the light died back down. Part of Harry’s life flowed back into him. Part had been lost as radiation. But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the silver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his voice whis- pered “Wingardium Leviosa”, the magic flowed obediently out of him and helped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn’t his magic he had expended, it had never been his magic that fuelled the Patronus Charm.) I swear, Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he could in Bellatrix’s presence, while tears streamed down his invisible cheeks, I swear upon my life and my magic and my art as a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacred and all my happy memories, I give my oath that some day I will end this place, please, please may I be forgiven… And the two of them walked on, as a murderess’s voice screamed and begged someone to come back and save her. There should have been more time, there should have been a ceremony, for Harry’s sacrifice of that piece of himself, but Bellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking without a pause, saying nothing, breathing evenly. So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would dwell in this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry came back some day with a company of other True Patronus casters and they destroyed all the Dementors here. Even if he melted the triangular building and burned the island low enough that the sea would wash over it, leaving no trace that such a place as this had ever once existed. Even then he wouldn’t get it back. 877 879 CH APTER 5 6 As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C spiral, shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous shield to their rear, Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and wondering if she ought to consult the obvious expert. If only he wasn’t so— Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would see as she turned. A third of her Aurors were spinning around and levelling their wands on the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver beard who had appeared directly within their midst, a bright red-golden phœnix on his shoulder. “Hold your fire!” Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but faking the phœnix travel would have been rather more difficult—the wards per- mitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though there were no fast ways out. The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long mo- ment. (Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors had sent the word, there were several former members of the Order of the Phœnix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her mind, if she’d seen Emmeline’s sparrow or Andy’s cat missing from the flock of bright creatures; but she knew that it was futile. It might not even be any of her people, for the old meddler often knew things he had no way at all of knowing.) Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous gesture. “I hope I am not unwelcome here,” the wizard said calmly. “We are all on the same side, are we not?” “That depends,” Amelia said in a hard voice. “Are you here to help us catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences of their ac- tions?” Are you going to try to stop the killer of my brother from getting her well- deserved Kiss, old meddler? From what Amelia heard, Dumbledore had be- come smarter toward the end of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye’s non- stop nagging; but had relapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Volde- mort’s body was found. A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the shining an- imals, gleamed off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses as he spoke. “Even less than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,” the old wizard said. “She must not leave this prison alive, Amelia.” Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised grati- fication, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and a blazing silver phœnix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps than all their other Patronuses put together. It was the first time she’d seen that spell cast wordlessly. “Order all your Aurors to cancel their Patronus Charms for ten seconds,” said the old wizard. “What darkness cannot find, the light may.” Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, who would notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding Dumble- dore’s will to be done. That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful silence, none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to weigh her own thoughts. She must not leave this prison alive… Albus Dumbledore wouldn’t turn into Bartemius Crouch without a strong reason. If he’d meant to tell her why, he already would have; but it certainly wasn’t a positive sign. Still, it was good to know they’d be able to work together on this one. “Now,” said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms winked out except that blazing silver phœnix. “Is there another Patronus still present?” the old wizard said clearly to the bright creature. The bright creature dipped its head in a nod. “Can you find it?” The silver head nodded again. “Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?” A final nod from the blazing phœnix. “It is done,” Dumbledore said. “Over,” said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised her wand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some extra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face, to think of the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of dwelling on the looming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss was a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the Patronus Charm.) 882 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V I: CONSTRAINE D OPTIMIZATION No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their Pa- tronus Charms, when— The blazing silver phœnix flew off, and the true red-golden phœnix followed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of them with his long wand gripped low. The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard like water, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple. “Albus!” shouted Amelia. “What do you think you’re doing?” But she already knew. “Do not follow me,” the old wizard’s voice said sternly. “I can protect myself, I cannot protect others.” The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors flinch. 883 CH APTER 5 6 884 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V I: CONSTRAINE D OPTIMIZATION 885 CH APTER 5 6 886 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V I: CONSTRAINE D OPTIMIZATION In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard’s striding legs came to an abrupt halt; for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had halted in mid-air, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant white phœnix craned its head, looking backward and forward as though confused; and then it turned to its master and shook its head in apology. Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the way he came. 887 CH APTER 5 6 888 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V I: CONSTRAINE D OPTIMIZATION The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the silver and the red-golden phœnixes now following behind. “You—” Amelia began to bellow. “They have dismissed their Patronus,” said Dumbledore. The old wiz- ard didn’t seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow overrode her own. “I cannot find them now.” Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks on hold, and turned to the communications officer. “Tell the duty room to ask the Dementors again if they can sense Bellatrix Black.” The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment, and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. “No—” Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind. “—but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn’t a pris- oner.” “Fine!” snapped Amelia. “Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its kind are authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and anyone in their company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they’re to Kiss her immediately!” Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to argue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held his peace. 889 CH APTER 5 6 89 0 891 CH APTER 57 892 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V II: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION “We have a fix!” shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as though in triumph. “The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to level seven, C spiral, that’s where they are!” Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly. “No,” Amelia said in a level voice. “That’s where one of them is. The De- mentors still can’t find Bellatrix Black. We are not running down there and letting her through in the confusion, and we are not dividing our forces to be ambushed. So long as we move with caution, we can’t lose. Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt to keep going down level by level, same as before—” The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn’t even bother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully constructed shields parted like water and rippled gently in his wake. 894 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V II: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 895 CH APTER 57 896 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V II: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION “I found him!” cried the old wizard’s voice. Who? thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore’s return, car- rying in his arms— —the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected to behold— —a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he’d fought a small war, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was chewing on a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand. Bahry One-Hand was alive. A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of them already starting to rush forward. “Stay on guard!” bellowed Amelia. “Check them both for Polyjuice— scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps—” The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively, looking at where Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by two strong Au- rors. “Do you understand this, Amelia?” “No,” she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn’t yet been able to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept outside the main party and guarded. “Perhaps,” the old wizard said at length, “whichever of their number can cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage. Someone who was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason, they left your Auror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly curses, when we find them—” “I see,” said the old witch in sudden realization, “that was their plan. It costs them nothing to Obliviate him and leave him alive, and makes us hesitate—” Amelia nodded decisively, and said to her people, “We carry on as before.” The old wizard sighed. “Any news from the Dementors?” “If I tell you,” Amelia snapped, “will you run off again?” “It costs you nothing, Amelia,” the old wizard said quietly, “and may save one of your own people the fight.” Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance— But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old wizard was often right in the end, it was part of what made him so annoying. “The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other per- son they said they saw,” Amelia told him, “and they will not say why, nor where.” Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phœnix on his shoulder, whose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent head- shake in reply. “I cannot detect them either,” said Dumbledore. Then he shrugged. “I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral from top to bottom and see if anything turns up, shall I?” Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that would have made the tiniest difference. “Albus,” said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, “even you can be ambushed.” “Nonsense, my dear,” the old wizard said cheerfully as he strode off yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand of uniden- tifiable dark-grey wood, “I’m invincible.” There was a pause. (“He didn’t just really say that—” whispered the newest Auror present, a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to the senior member of her trio, Auror Brooks. “Did he?”) (“He can get away with it,” Isabel whispered back to her, “he’s Dumble- dore, not even Fate takes him seriously any more.”) “And that,” Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger Aurors, “is why we never call him in on anything unless we absolutely must.” 9 00 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V II: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began to feel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had worked a third of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so as not to allow any gap in their coverage that could be jumped by cutting through a ceiling, and they’d yet to find any sign. “Might I ask you to report?” Amelia said, keeping the edge out of her voice. “First a simple walk from top to bottom,” said the old wizard. He was frowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. “I examined Bella- trix’s cell, and found a death doll left in her place. This escape was meant to go unremarked, I think. There is something hidden in the corner be- neath a scrap of cloth; I left that undisturbed for your Aurors to examine. On the return trip, I opened each door and looked within the cells. I saw nothing Disillusioned, only the prisoners—” They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phœnix, and all her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an urgent de- mand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor on the spot. “—in rather distressing condition,” Dumbledore said quietly. For a moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon glasses. “Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their actions?” “I did not—” Amelia began. “I know,” said the old wizard. “My apologies, Amelia.” He sighed. “Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their magic left, when I looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power; the strongest had only as much magic left as a first-year child. I heard Fawkes scream in distress many times, but never challenge. It seems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well enough to escape my mere glance.” 9 01 CH APTER 57 9 02 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V II: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 9 03 CH APTER 57 9 04 9 05 CH APTER 58 9 06 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 9 07 CH APTER 58 9 08 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION Her Auror team was around three-quarters of the way down Azkaban, as were the other two teams on the other two spirals. Amelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the criminals hiding on the second-to-lowest floor, part of her wished Dumbledore had thought to check that specific floor more carefully and part of her was glad he hadn’t. And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny ‘tink’ noise coming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowest floor, say. Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she man- aged to stop herself. The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, “Since you asked it, Amelia,” and went off yet again. 910 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal door and opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells within were empty. Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then, be- fore he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total, with so few cells left to check. 911 CH APTER 58 912 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 913 CH APTER 58 The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from behind which came an endless dead mutter, “I’m not serious, I’m not serious, I’m not serious…” The red-golden phœnix on his shoulder was already scream- ing urgently, and the old wizard was already wincing, when— Another cry pierced the corridor, phœnix-like but not the true phœnix’s call. The wizard’s head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature on his other shoulder, even as ephemeral and immaterial talons launched the spell-entity into the air. The false phœnix flew down the corridor. The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young man of sixty. The true phœnix screamed once, twice, and a third time, hovering be- fore the metal door; and then, when it became clear that its master would not return for all its calling, flew reluctantly after. 914 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 915 CH APTER 58 916 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT V III: CONSTRAINE D CO G NITION 917 919 CH APTER 59 crapNewton 92 0 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y 921 CH APTER 59 “WHAT?” shrieked Amelia at the mirror. 92 2 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y 923 CH APTER 59 924 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y 925 CH APTER 59 There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door, causing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around with her wand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal Albus Dumble- dore, standing there in front of a great smoking hole in the prison wall. “Amelia,” said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his custom- ary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his half-moon glasses. “I must leave Azkaban and I must do so now. Is there any faster way than a broomstick to get beyond the wards?” “No—” “Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!” The place where Amelia wanted to be was with the Auror who had been injured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been. What she needed to do was find out what Dumbledore knew. “You!” the old witch barked at the team around her. “Keep clearing the corridors until you’re at bottom, they may not all have escaped yet!” And then, to the old wizard, “Two broomsticks. You can brief me once we’re in the air.” There was a match of stares, but not a long one. 926 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly occluded by a rain cloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the direction of the wind and faster than the wind. “Who’s behind it?” shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a pace away from her. “One of two people,” Dumbledore said back, “I know not, at this in- stant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all in far greater trouble.” Amelia didn’t spare any breath for sighs. “When will you know?” The old wizard’s voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising above the wind. “Three things they need for perfection, if it is that one: the flesh of the Dark Lord’s most faithful servant, the blood of the Dark Lord’s greatest foe, and access to a certain grave. I had thought Harry Potter safe, with their attempt on Azkaban all but failed—though I still set guards upon him—but now I am fearful indeed. They have access to Time, someone with a Time-Turner is sending messages for them; and I suspect the kidnap attempt on Harry Potter has already taken place some hours ago. Which is why we have not heard about it, being in Azkaban where Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future, you see.” “And if it is the other?” shouted Amelia. What she had heard already was worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark rituals, and centring on the dead Dark Lord himself. The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only shook his head. 927 CH APTER 59 928 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y 929 CH APTER 59 930 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT IX: CURIOSIT Y 931 CH APTER 59 “Where will you go?” yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge of the wards. “Backward in time to protect Harry Potter,” said the old wizard, and before Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted help, she felt the boundary of the wards as they crossed them. There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phœnix van- ished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick. CHAPTER SIXT Y THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, PART X “Wake.” Harry’s eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a jerking start of his prone body. He couldn’t remember any dreams, maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like he’d only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment after. “You must awaken,” said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. “I gave you as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at least one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four hours to Mary’s Place, appearing in every way as though we have done nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before then.” Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached, and not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete. Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his unconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper nightmare. Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing the metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the empti- ness tried to suck all life out of the world— Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had remained af- ter fat and muscle faded— A metal door— A woman’s voice— No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die— I can’t remember my children’s names any more— Don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t— “What was that place?” Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black’s voice had been. “What was that place? That wasn’t a prison, that was Hell!” “Hell?” said the calm voice of the Defence Professor. “You mean the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a similarity.” “How—” Harry’s voice was blocking, there was something huge lodged in his throat. “How—how could they—” People had built that place, someone had made Azkaban, they’d made it on purpose, they’d done it deliberately, that woman, she’d had children, children she wouldn’t remember, some judge had decided for that to happen to her, someone had needed to drag her into that cell and lock its door while she screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away without letting her out— “How could people do that?” “Why shouldn’t they?” said the Defence Professor. A pale blue light lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete ceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting some distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted wall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the dust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become an ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay over him. “What use are the prisoners of Azka- ban to them?” Harry’s mouth opened in a croak. No words exited. A faint smile twitched on the Defence Professor’s lips. “You know, Mr Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over mag- ical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if instead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would order Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make Azkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty sermons and imagining them- selves not to be villains…well, Mr Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord.” “I don’t understand,” Harry said, his voice was shaking, he’d read about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the ordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they were assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that the experiment hadn’t examined the right question, the one most important question, they hadn’t looked at the key people, not the prison guards but everyone else, “I really don’t understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and let this happen, why is the country of magical Britain doing this—” Harry’s voice stopped. The Defence Professor’s eyes appeared to be the same colour as always, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same colour as Quirinus Quir- rell’s irises, those never-thawing chips of ice. “Welcome, Mr Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of politics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer any faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who openly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals, with weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not think about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after all. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back the winner.” A coldly amused laugh. “You see, Mr Potter, no-one ever quite believes that they will go to Azkaban, so they see no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on others…I suppose you were once told that people care about that sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr Potter, people don’t care in the slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you would have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those now pris- oner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who pledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr Potter, that I see lit- tle hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction.” Harry’s recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into frag- ments again, the words falling like hammer strikes on his consciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice where lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something to save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words, but it did not come. The Defence Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more cu- riosity than command. “It is very simple, Mr Potter, to understand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men care for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so long as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their cruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of this country are no different within than he who sought to rule over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his…frankness.” The boy’s hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the nails cut into his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was pale you couldn’t have seen that, for the dim blue light cast all into ice or shadow. “You once offered to support me if my ambition were to be the next Dark Lord. Is that why, Professor?” The Defence Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his lips. “Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr Potter, and you will rule this coun- try in time. Then you may tear down the prison that democracy made, if you find that Azkaban still offends your sensibilities. Like it or not, Mr Potter, you have seen this day that your own will conflicts with the will of this country’s populace, and that you do not bow your head and submit to their decision when that occurs. So to them, whether or not they know it, and whether or not you acknowledge it, you are their next Dark Lord.” In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the Defence Professor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of their eyes reduced to similar colours, looking very much the same in that light. Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the long-suppressed questions, the ones he’d told himself he was putting on hold until the Ides of May. That had been a lie, Harry now knew, a self-deception, he had kept silent for fear of what he might hear. And now everything was coming forth from his lips, all at once. “On our first day of class, you tried to convince my classmates I was a killer.” “You are.” Amusedly. “But if your question is why I told them that, Mr Potter, the answer is that you will find ambiguity a great ally on your road to power. Give a sign of Slytherin on one day, and contradict it with a sign of Gryffindor the next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believe what they wish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supporting you as well. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whatever seems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear strong, so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will tell them that their advantage lies with you. Walk always in the shadow, and light and darkness both will follow.” “And,” said the boy, his voice level, “just what do you want out of all this?” Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall from where he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from pale ice into dark pits like those of his snake form. “I wish for Britain to grow strong under a strong leader; that is my desire. As for my reasons why,” Professor Quirrell smiled without mirth, “I think they shall stay my own.” “The sense of doom that I feel around you.” The words were becom- ing harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and closer to something terrible and forbidden. “You always knew what it meant.” “I had several guesses,” said Professor Quirrell, his expression unread- able. “And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I will tell you: it is your doom which flares when we come near, not mine.” For once Harry’s brain managed to mark this as a questionable asser- tion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it heard. “Why do you sometimes turn into a zombie?” “Personal reasons,” said Professor Quirrell with no humour at all in his voice. “What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?” There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to control his breathing, keep it steady. Finally the Defence Professor shrugged, as though it were of no ac- count. “I all but spelled it out for you, Mr Potter. I told you everything you needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature enough to con- sider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was the Dark Lord’s most powerful servant, her loyalty the most assured; she was the single person most likely to be entrusted with some part of the lost lore of Slytherin that should have been yours.” Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something terri- ble beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he would say some- thing that he really shouldn’t say while the two of them were alone in a deserted warehouse— “But she was innocent,” said the Defence Professor. He was not smil- ing. “And the degree to which all her choices were taken away from her, so that she never had a chance to suffer for her own mistakes…it struck me as excessive, Mr Potter. If she tells you nothing of use—” The Defence Professor gave another small shrug. “I shall not consider this day’s work a waste.” “How altruistic of you,” Harry said coldly. “So if all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that, then?” The Defence Professor’s eyes were still in shadow, dark pits that could not be met. “Call it a whim, Mr Potter. It has sometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that You-Know-Who would say the same.” Harry opened his mouth a final time— And found that he couldn’t say it, he couldn’t ask the last question, the last and most important question, he couldn’t make the words come out. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden to a rationalist, for all that he’d ever recited the Litany of Tarski or the Litany of Gendlin or sworn that whatever could be destroyed by the truth should be, in that one moment, he could not bring himself to say his last question out loud. Even though he knew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew he was supposed to be better than this, he still couldn’t say it. “Now it is my turn to inquire of you.” Professor Quirrell’s back straight- ened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall of painted concrete. “I was wondering, Mr Potter, if you had anything to say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual endeavour. I am given to under- stand that an apology, in such cases, is considered a sign of respect. But you have not offered me one. Is it just that you have not yet got around to it, Mr Potter?” The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it would slice all the way through you before you realized you were being murdered. And Harry just looked at the Defence Professor with cool eyes that would never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was no longer in Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that was fearless; and the solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to meet the stress, turning smoothly from one facet to another, from light to darkness, warm to cold. A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put me in a position where I must submit? Genuine emotion on his part? “I see,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose that answers—” “No,” said the boy in a cool, collected voice, “you do not get to frame the conversation that easily, Professor. I went to considerable lengths to pro- tect you and get you out of Azkaban safely, after I thought you had tried to kill a police officer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when you demanded it, would you have said ‘thank you’ in turn? Or am I correct in thinking that it was my submission you demanded there, and not only my respect?” There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell’s voice came in reply, openly icy with danger no longer veiled. “It seems you still cannot bring yourself to lose, Mr Potter.” Darkness stared out of Harry’s eyes without flinching, the Defence Professor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them. “Oh, and are you pondering now, whether you should pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before my own anger, in order to preserve your own plans? Did the thought of a calculated false apology even cross your mind? Me neither, Professor Quirrell.” The Defence Professor laughed, low and humourless, emptier than the void between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with hard ra- diation. “No, Mr Potter, you have not learned your lesson, not at all.” “I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban,” said the boy, his voice level. “That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over to the Aurors. Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I heard your voice saying it to me, in my mind; and I would have done it, if I had been there by myself. But I could not bring myself to lose you.” There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defence Profes- sor could not quite think of what to say to that. “I am curious,” said Professor Quirrell at last. “What do you think that I should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit instructions in the event of a fight. You were to stay down, stay out of the way, cast no magic. You violated those instructions and brought down the mission.” “I made no decision,” the boy said evenly, “there was no choice in it, only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus was there. For that wish to have never occurred, you should have warned me that you might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I assume that if you point your wand at someone and say Avada Kedavra, it is because you want them dead. Shouldn’t that be the first rule of Unforgivable Curse Safety?” “Rules are for duels,” said the Defence Professor. Some of the coldness had returned to his voice. “And duelling is a sport, not a branch of Battle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be blocked and must be dodged is an indispensable tactic. I would have thought this obvious to you, but it seems I misjudged your intellect.” “It also seems to me imprudent,” said the boy, continuing as though the other had not spoken, “to not tell me that my casting any spell on you might kill us both. What if you had suffered some mishap, and I had tried an Innervate, or a Hover Charm? That ignorance, which you permitted for purposes I cannot guess, played also some part in this catastrophe.” There was another silence. The Defence Professor’s eyes had narrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as though he had encoun- tered some completely unfamiliar situation; and still the man spoke no word. “Well,” said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defence Pro- fessor’s. “I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do not think the situation calls for me to submit to you. I never really did understand the concept of apology, still less as it applies to a situation like this; if you have my regrets, but not my submission, does that count as saying sorry?” Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the stars. “I wouldn’t know,” said the Defence Professor, “I, too, never under- stood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile between us, it seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us speak no more of it, then. Debts will be settled between us in time.” There was silence for a time. “By the way,” said the boy. “Hermione Granger would never have built Azkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she’d die before she hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you said before that all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and that’s just false as a point of simple fact. Would’ve realized it earlier if I hadn’t been,” the boy gave a brief grim smile, “stressed out.” The Defence Professor’s eyes were half-lidded, his expression distant. “People’s insides are not always like their outsides, Mr Potter. Perhaps she simply wishes others to think of her as a good girl. She cannot use the Patronus Charm—” “Hah,” said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. “She’s hav- ing trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There’s enough light in her to destroy Dementors, I’m sure. She wouldn’t be able to stop herself from de- stroying Dementors, even at the cost of her own life…” The boy trailed off, and then his voice resumed. “I might not be such a good person, maybe; but they do exist, and she’s one of them.” Dryly. “She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her little.” There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, “Professor, I have to ask, when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn’t it ever occur to you to try and improve it somehow? Like, yes, something goes terribly wrong in people’s heads that makes them think it’s great to torture criminals, but that doesn’t mean they’re truly evil inside; and maybe if you taught them the right things, showed them what they were doing wrong, you could change—” Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of be- fore. “Ah, Mr Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you are. Sooner you could change the colour of the sky.” Another chuckle, this one colder. “And the reason it is easy for you to forgive such fools and think well of them, Mr Potter, is that you yourself have not been sorely hurt. You will think less fondly of commonplace idiots after the first time their folly costs you something dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from your own pocket, perhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred strangers.” The Defence Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocket watch out of his robes, looked at it. “Let us depart now, if there is nothing more to say between us.” “You don’t have any questions about the impossible things I did to get us out of Azkaban?” “No,” said the Defence Professor. “I believe I have solved most of them already. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a person whom I cannot see through immediately, be they friend or foe. I shall unravel the puzzles about you for myself, in due time.” The Defence Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the wall with both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too slowly. The boy, less gracefully, did the same. And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he had earlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would make it real, and as though it were not, already, vastly obvious. “Why am I not like the other children my own age?” 942 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT X Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures facing off across from each other. One entity who wore the shape of a man in his late thirties and already balding, and another mind that wore the form of an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his forehead. Ice and shadow, pale blue light. “I don’t know,” said the man. The boy just looked at him. And then said, “Oh, really?” “Truly,” said the man. “I know nothing, and of my guesses I will not speak. Yet I will say this much—” CHAPTER SIXT Y-ONE THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIME NT, PART XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS Through green flame they whirled, through the Floo network they spun, Minerva’s heart racing with a pounding horror that she hadn’t felt in ten years and three months, the corridors between space coughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest Floo receiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to intercept, the fastest way out of Hogwarts without a phœnix). A goblin attendant turned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a slightly respectful bow— Determination, Destination, Deliberation! And the two of them were in the alley just behind Mary’s Place, wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back and the words of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to Severus’s lips. The alley was empty. When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already crack- ing down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as his lips chanted words of invisibility; he took on the colours of his surroundings, became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved and matched what was behind him and then there was nothing there. She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her own Disillusionment— From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame. She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn and raised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the half-circles of his glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had spread his fire-coloured wings in readiness for flight and fight. “Albus!” she said. “I thought—” She’d just seen him depart for Azk- aban, and she’d thought not even phœnixes could return from there so easily. Then she realized. “She escaped,” said Albus. “Did your Patronus reach him?” The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins so- lidified. “He said he was here, in the toilets—” “Let us hope he spoke true,” said Albus, the wand tapped her head with a sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment later the four of them (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible, though sometimes you saw a flicker of something like fire in his air) were racing to the front of the restaurant. They paused before the door while Albus whispered something, and a moment later one of the customers visible through the windows stood up with a vague look on his face and opened the door as though taking a quick look outside for some friend; and the three of them were through, racing past the unwitting customers (Severus was mark- ing their faces, Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned) toward the sign that pointed to the toilets— An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open with a slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it. The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of water showed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a sheet of paper left on the closed lid of the toilet. She couldn’t breathe. The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a moment later was thrust in her own direction. M: What did the hat tell me to tell you? —H “Ah,” Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment to place the question, it wasn’t the sort of thing you’d forget but she hadn’t been thinking in that mode, really—“I’m an impudent youngster and I should get off its lawn.” “Eh?” said the air in Albus’s voice, as if even he could be shocked. And then Harry Potter’s head appeared, suspended next to the air be- side the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry she’d seen sometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around. “What’s going on—” the boy began. Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was moving forward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and plucked a hair from Harry’s head (producing a startled yelp from the boy), Minerva ac- cepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment later Albus swept up the mostly-invisible boy in his arms and there was a flash of red-golden fire. And Harry Potter was safe. Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where Albus and Harry had been, trying to recover her poise. She’d…lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of the Phœnix had disbanded. Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand was already drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand already stretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry’s hair, and a moment later, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice, which at once be- gan fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the potency that would enable Severus to act his part as bait. “That was unexpected,” the Potions Master said slowly. “Why did our Headmaster not retrieve Mr Potter earlier, I wonder, if he was going so far as to twist Time? There should have been nothing preventing him from do- ing so…indeed, your Patronus should have found Mr Potter already safe…” She hadn’t thought of that, a different realization having jumped to the forefront of her mind. It wasn’t nearly as horrifying as Bellatrix Black having escaped from Azkaban, but still— “Harry has an invisibility cloak?” she said. The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking. 947 CH APTER 61 948 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 949 CH APTER 61 950 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 951 CH APTER 61 952 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 953 CH APTER 61 954 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 955 CH APTER 61 956 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 957 CH APTER 61 958 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 959 CH APTER 61 960 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT XI: SECRECY AND OPE NNESS 961 CH APTER 61 Some hours later… The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress’s office had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the clock-face; it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions, for there was a Quieting enchantment on it. The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, the golden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Time nearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to collide. It was 8:43 p.m., and the time approached when Harry’s Time-Turner would open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell could fool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself. No body or soul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra seven hours in a single day. She would make up a message on the spot, and tell Harry to take that message back six hours to Professor Flitwick at 3 p.m., and she would ask Professor Flitwick if he had received it in that hour. And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed received it at 3 p.m. And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a little more faith in Harry next time. Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her shining cat, “Go to Mr Potter, and tell him this: Mr Potter, please come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing anything else along the way.” CHAPTER SIXT Y-TWO THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, FINAL Minerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver nu- merals, the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until they had, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a sanded hourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was built. It was one of the things that blood purists wished not to be true, and therefore Minerva knew it. She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T., which now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little she knew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was a sham, taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggle-borns could not ap- preciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually because the Board of Governors did not approve of Muggles at all. But when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main thing that mattered to her, she was saddened to remember… If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire! She couldn’t imagine it, and the reason she couldn’t imagine it was that she couldn’t imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who. She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each one, three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at her side. She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint green scales scat- tered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the voice that laughed in a high- pitched hiss and promised nothing but cruelty and torment: the monster pure and complete. And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright expres- sion on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking the ludicrous seriously and taking the serious ludicrously. And to think of the two of them facing off at wand-point was too painful to be imagined. They had no right, no right at all to set this on an eleven-year-old boy. She knew what the Headmaster had decided for him this day, for she had been told to make the arrangements; and if it had been her at the same age she would have raged and screamed and cried and been inconsolable for weeks, and… He is no ordinary first-year, Albus had said. He is marked as the Dark Lord’s equal, and he has power the Dark Lord knows not. The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney’s throat, the true and original prophecy, echoed once more through her mind. She had a feeling it didn’t mean what the Headmaster thought it did, but there was no way to put the difference into words. And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any eleven-year-old within the Earth entire who could bear this burden, that boy approached her office now. And if she said anything at all like ‘poor Harry’ to his face… well, he wouldn’t like it. So now I’ve got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard, Harry had said on the day he had first learned. I really wish you had told me that before I started shopping… She’d been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she’d watched enough friends die, to know that there were some people you couldn’t save from becoming heroes. There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said, “En- ter.” When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she’d seen in Mary’s Place; and she wondered for an instant if he’d been wearing that same mask, that same self, this whole day. The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and said, “So is it time for me to be told what’s going on?” Neutral the words, not the sharpness that should have gone with the expression. Professor McGonagall’s eyes rose in surprise before she could stop them, and she said, “The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr Potter?” The boy shook his head. “Only that he’d received a warning that I might be in danger, but I was safe now.” Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they do this to him, how could they lay this upon an eleven-year-old boy, this war, this destiny, this prophecy…and they didn’t even trust him… She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his green eyes were calm as they rested on her. “Professor McGonagall?” the boy said quietly. “Mr Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, “I’m afraid it is not my place to explain, but if after this the Headmaster still does not tell you anything, you may come back to me and I will go yell at him for you.” The boy’s eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing through the crack before the cool mask was set back in place. “In any case,” Professor McGonagall said briskly. “I’m sorry for the in- convenience, Mr Potter, but I need to ask you to use your Time-Turner to go back six hours to three o’clock, and give the following message to Pro- fessor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask the Professor to note down the time at which you gave him that message. Afterwards the Headmaster wishes to meet with you at your convenience.” There was a pause. Then the boy said, “I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner, then?” “Not by me!” Professor McGonagall said hastily. “I am sorry for the in- convenience, Mr Potter.” There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. “It’ll play hell with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can’t be helped. Please let the house elves know that if I ask for an early breakfast at, say, three a.m. to- morrow morning, I’m to receive it.” “Of course, Mr Potter,” she said. “Thank you for understanding.” The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then slipped out the door with his hand already going under his shirt to where his Time-Turner waited; and she almost called out Harry! only she wouldn’t have known what to say after. Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock. How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in time? She didn’t need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it, then it had already happened… Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was nervous, and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes, unspeakable unthink- able mischief with all the prudence and foresight of a falling rock—she didn’t know how the boy had tricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryf- findor where he obviously belonged—but nothing dark or harmful, not ever. Beneath that mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as the Weasley twins’, though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have made her say that out loud. “Expecto Patronum,” she said, and then, “Go to Professor Flitwick, and bear back his reply after you ask him this: ‘Did Mr Potter give you a mes- sage from me, what was that message, and when did you receive it?’” 966 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, FINAL 967 CH APTER 62 Even Harry’s dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time the spi- ralling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door that was the final gate to Dumbledore’s office; but since Harry was now legally four hours past his natural bedtime, it was safe to let some of the fatigue show, the physical if not the emotional. The oaken door swung open— Harry’s eyes had already been focused in the direction of the great desk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register that the throne was empty, the desk barren but for a single leather-bound volume; and then Harry shifted his gaze to see the wizard standing among his fid- dly things, the mysterious unknown devices in their scores. Fawkes and the Sorting Hat occupied their respective perches, a bright cheerful blaze crackled in a nook that Harry had not before realized was a fireplace, and there were the two umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All things in their place and in their customary appearance except the old wizard himself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal black. It came as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person, it was as if Harry had seen his father wearing a business suit. Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and sorrow- ful. “Hello, Harry,” said the old wizard. From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency con- struct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was happen- ing inclined his head coldly, and said, “Headmaster. I expect you’ve heard back from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if it’s fine by you, I would really like to know what is going on.” “Yes,” said the old wizard, “it is time, Harry Potter.” The back straight- ened, only slightly for the wizard had already been standing straight; but somehow even that small change made the wizard seem a foot taller, and stronger if not younger, formidable though not dangerous, his potency gathered about him like a cowl. In a clear voice, then, he spoke: “This day your war against Voldemort has begun.” “What?” said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while something watching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more pro- fanity attached. “Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped from a prison inescapable,” the old wizard said. “It is a feat that bears Volde- mort’s signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his most faithful servant, is one of three requisites he must obtain to rise again in a new body. After ten years the enemy you once defeated has returned, as was foretold.” Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at least not for the few seconds before the old wizard continued. “It need change little for you, for now,” said the old wizard. “I have begun reconstituting the Order of the Phœnix that will serve you, I have alerted the few souls who can and should understand: Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain others. Of the prophecy—yes, there is a prophecy—I have not told them, but they know that Voldemort is returned, and they know that you are to play some vital role. They and I shall fight your war in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger, and perhaps wiser, here at Hogwarts.” The old wizard’s hand came up, as though beseeching. “So to you, for now, there is but one change, and I implore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book on my desk, Harry?” The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head against imaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at what proved to be— There was a rather long pause. Then Harry said, “It is a copy of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.” “You recognized a quote from that book,” said Dumbledore, an intent look in his eyes, “so I assume you remember it well. If I am mistaken, let me be corrected.” Harry just stared at him. “It is important to understand,” said Dumbledore, “that this book is not a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien never fought Voldemort. Your war will not be like the books you have read. Real life is not like stories. Do you understand, Harry?” Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head no. “In particular,” said Dumbledore, “there is a certain very foolish thing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many mistakes, does Tolkien’s wizard; but this one error is the most unforgivable. That mistake is this: when Gandalf first suspected, even for a moment, that Frodo held the One Ring, he should have moved Frodo to Rivendell at once. He might have been embarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicions had proven false. He might have found it awkward to so command Frodo, and Frodo would have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to set aside many other plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment, and awkwardness, and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to the loss of your whole war, when the nine Nazgûl swoop down on the Shire while you are reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring at once. And it is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all Middle-Earth would have fallen into slavery. If it had not been only a story, Harry, they would have lost their war. Do you understand what I am saying?” “Er…” said Harry, “not exactly…” There was something about Dumble- dore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay properly cold; his dark side had trouble with weird. “Then I will spell it out,” said the old wizard. His voice was stern, his eyes were sad. “Frodo should have been moved to Rivendell at once by Gan- dalf himself—and Frodo should never have left Rivendell without guard. There should have been no night of terror in Bree, no Barrow-downs, no Weathertop where Frodo was wounded, they could have lost their entire war any of those times, for Gandalf’s folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you, son of Michael and Petunia?” And the Harry who knew nothing did understand. And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the wise, the intelligent and sane, the right thing to do. And the Harry who knew nothing said just what innocent-Harry would have said, while the silent watcher screamed in confusion and agony. “You’re saying,” Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions inside burned through the outer calm, “that I’m not going home to my parents for Easter.” “You will see them again,” the old wizard said swiftly. “I will beg them to come here to be with you, I will extend them every courtesy during their visits. But you are not going home for Easter, Harry. You are not going home for the summer. You are no longer taking lunches in Diagon Alley, even with Professor Quirrell to watch you. Your blood is the second requisite Voldemort needs to rise as strong as before. So you are never again leaving the bounds of Hogwarts’s wards without a vital reason, and a guard strong enough to fend off any attack for long enough to get you to safety.” Water was beginning at the corners of Harry’s eyes. “Is that a request?” said his quavering voice. “Or an order?” “I’m sorry, Harry,” the old wizard said softly. “Your parents will see the necessity, I hope; but if not…I am afraid they have no recourse; the law, however wrongly, does not recognize them as your guardians. I am sorry, Harry, and I will understand if you despise me for it, but it must be done.” Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn’t look at Dumbledore any more, couldn’t trust his own face. This is the cost to yourself, said Hufflepuff within his mind, even as you imposed costs on others. Will that change your whole view of the matter, the way Professor Quirrell thinks it will? Automatically, the mask of innocent-Harry said exactly what it would have said: “Are my parents in danger? Do they need to be moved here?” “No,” said the old wizard’s voice. “I do not think so. The Death Eaters learned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the Order’s families. And if Voldemort is now acting without his former companions, he still knows that it is I who make the decisions for now, and he knows that I would give him nothing for any threat to your family. I have taught him that I do not give in to blackmail, and so he will not try.” Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard’s face to match the shift in his voice, Dumbledore’s blue eyes grown hard as steel behind the glasses, it didn’t match the person but it matched the formal black robes. “Is that everything, then?” said Harry’s trembling voice. Later he would think about this, later he would think of some cunning counter- measure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was any way to convince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now, maintaining the mask was taking all of Harry’s attention. “Voldemort used a Muggle artefact to escape Azkaban,” the old wizard said. “He is watching you and learning from you, Harry Potter. Soon a man named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue an edict that all use of Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defence Professor’s battles. In the future, when you have a good idea, keep it closer about yourself.” It didn’t seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and said again, “Is that everything?” There was a pause. “Please,” said the old wizard in a whisper. “I have no right to ask your forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please, at least say that you understand why.” There was water in the old wizard’s eyes. “I understand,” said the voice of the outer Harry who did understand, “I mean…I was sort of thinking about it anyway…wondering whether I could get you and my parents to let me stay over at Hogwarts during the summer like the orphans, so I could read the library here, it’s just more interesting at Hogwarts anyway…” A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore’s throat. Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn’t escape unscathed, but it was escape. He took a step forward. His hand reached to the door handle. A piercing cry split the air— As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phœnix already launched through the air and winging toward him. From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a flash of panic, he hadn’t thought of that, hadn’t anticipated it, he’d prepared to face Dumbledore but he’d forgotten about Fawkes— Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phœnix’s wings flapped like the flaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to pass too slowly as Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward where Harry stood. And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentle wing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame. “What is it, Fawkes?” said the false Harry in puzzlement, looking the phœnix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent. The real Harry, feel- ing the same awful sickness inside as when Professor McGonagall had expressed her trust in him, thought, Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn’t think I was evil…Do you hate me now? If I’ve become something a phœnix hates, maybe I should just give it up now, give up everything now and confess— Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, a scream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping figures start within their portraits. It pierced through all of Harry’s defences like a white-hot sword through butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured balloon popping, reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he remembered the one most important thing; the tears began pouring freely from Harry’s eyes, down his cheeks, his voice choked as the words came out of his throat like coughing up lava— “Fawkes says,” Harry’s voice said, “he wants me, to do, something, about, the prisoners, in Azkaban—” “Fawkes, no!” said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode forward, reach- ing out to the phœnix with a pleading hand. The old wizard’s voice was almost as desperate as the phœnix’s scream had been. “You cannot ask that of him, Fawkes, he’s only a boy still!” “You went to Azkaban,” Harry whispered, “you took Fawkes with you, he saw—you saw—you were there, you saw—Why didn’t you do anything? Why didn’t you let them out?” When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that Fawkes had screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the phœnix was now flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his side, the red- golden head level with his own. “Can you,” whispered the old wizard, “can you truly hear the voice of the phœnix so clearly?” Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal doors he’d passed, the voices he’d heard, the worst memories, the desperate begging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his mind like fire at the phœnix’s scream, all the inner bulwarks smashed. Harry didn’t know whether he could truly hear the voice of the phœnix so clearly, whether he would have understood Fawkes without already knowing. All Harry knew was that he had a plausible excuse to say the things Professor Quirrell had told him he must never raise in conversation from this day forth; because this was just what innocent-Harry would have said, would have done, if he had heard so clearly. “They’re hurting—we have to help them—” “I can’t!” cried Albus Dumbledore. “Harry, Fawkes, I can’t, there’s noth- ing I can do!” Another piercing scream. “WHY NOT? JUST GO IN AND TAKE THEM OUT!” The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phœnix, his eyes meet- ing Harry’s instead. “Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it’s not that sim- ple! Phœnixes aren’t mere animals but they are animals, Harry, they can’t understand—” “I don’t understand either,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I don’t understand why you’re feeding people to Dementors! Azkaban isn’t a prison, it’s a torture chamber and you’re torturing those people to death!” “Percival,” said the old wizard hoarsely, “Percival Dumbledore, my own father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know it is a horror! But what would you have of me? To break Azkaban by force? Would you have me declare open rebellion against the Ministry?” CAW! There was a pause, and Harry’s trembling voice said, “Fawkes doesn’t know anything about governments, he just wants you—to take the prison- ers out—of their cells—and he’ll help you fight, if anyone stands in your way—and—and so will I, Headmaster! I’ll go with you and destroy any De- mentor that comes near! We’ll worry about the political fallout afterwards, I bet that you and I together could get away with it—” “Harry,” whispered the old wizard, “phœnixes do not understand how winning a battle can lose a war.” Tears were streaming down the old wiz- ard’s cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. “The battle is all they know. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose wizards to be their masters.” “Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?” Harry’s voice was begging, now. “Bring them out in groups of fifteen—I think I could destroy that many at a time without hurting myself—” The old wizard shook his head. “It was hard enough to pass off the loss of one—they might give me one more, but never two—they are con- sidered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war—” Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have come from where a phœnix now rested on his own shoulder, and it might have come from his own dark side, and the two angers mixed within him, the cold and the hot, and it was a strange voice that said from his throat, “Tell me something. What does a government have to do, what do the voters have to do with their democracy, what do the people of a country have to do, be- fore I ought to decide that I’m not on their side any more?” The old wizard’s eyes widened where he stared at the boy with a phœnix upon his shoulder. “Harry…are those your words, or the Defence Professor’s—” “Because there has to be some point, doesn’t there? And if it’s not Azk- aban, where is it, then?” “Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together if they each declared rebellion against the whole, every time they differed! Al- ways there will be something—” “Azkaban is not just something! It’s evil!” “Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not perfectly good! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in chaos; and for you and I to break Azkaban by force would be the beginning of chaos, can you not see it?” The old wizard’s voice was pleading. “And it is possible to oppose the will of your fellows openly or in secret, without hating them, without declaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of this country deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did—what of the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the many good people mixed in with the bad?” Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw the phœnix’s eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet they blazed, red flames in a sea of golden fire. What do you think, Fawkes? “Caw?” said the phœnix. Fawkes didn’t understand the conversation. The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick voice, “Or maybe the phœnixes are wiser than us, smarter than us, maybe they fol- low us around hoping that some day we’ll listen to them, some day we’ll get it, some day we’ll just take, the prisoners, out, of their cells—” Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto the stair- case and slammed the door behind him. The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put his face in his hands, and began to weep. It wasn’t until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the dif- ference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and realized that— “Fawkes?” Harry whispered. —the phœnix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had seen him a few times upon Dumbledore’s. Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire. “You’re not my phœnix now…are you?” Caw! “Oh,” Harry said, his voice trembling a little, “I’m glad to hear that, Fawkes, because I don’t think—the Headmaster—I don’t think he deserves—” Harry stopped, took a breath. “I don’t think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the right thing…” Caw! “But you’re angry at him and trying to make a point. I understand.” The phœnix nestled his head against Harry’s shoulder, and the stone gargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into the corridors of Hogwarts. CHAPTER SIXT Y-THREE THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIME NT, AFTERMATHS Aftermath, Hermione Granger She was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up their own books across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked into the Raven- claw common room; and it was only then that she realized, she hadn’t seen him at all since breakfast. That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling one. There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry’s shoulder, a bright bird of fire. And Harry looked sad and worn and really tired like the phœnix was the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was still a warmth about him, if you crossed your eyes you might have thought you were looking at the Headmaster somehow, that was the impression that went through Hermione’s mind even though it didn’t make any sense. Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofas full of staring girls, past card-game circles of staring boys, heading for her. In theory she wasn’t talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn’t up until tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a whole lot more important than that— “Fawkes,” Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, “that girl over there is Hermione Granger, she’s not talking to me right now because I’m an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person’s shoulder she’s better than me.” So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter’s voice— But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phœnix had glided off Harry’s shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fast- forward, flashing toward her; there was a phœnix flying in front of her and staring at her with eyes of light and flame. “Caw?” asked the phœnix. Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a test she’d forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she’d gone her whole life without studying for it, she couldn’t find anything to say. “I’m—” she said. “I’m only twelve, I haven’t done anything yet—” The phœnix just glided gently around, rotating around one wing-tip like the being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter’s shoulder, where it settled down quite firmly. “You silly boy,” said Padma across from her, looking like she was decid- ing whether to laugh or grimace, “phœnixes aren’t for smart girls who do their homework, they’re for idiots who charge straight at five older Slythe- rin bullies. There’s a reason why the Gryffindor colours are red and gold, you know.” There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room. Hermione wasn’t one of the laughing ones. Neither was Harry. Harry had put a hand over his face. “Tell Hermione I’m sorry,” he said to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. “Tell her I forgot that phœnixes are animals, they don’t understand time and planning, they don’t understand people who are going to do good things later—I’m not sure they understand really the notion of there being something that a person is, all they see is what people do. Fawkes doesn’t know what twelve means. Tell Hermione I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have—it just all goes wrong, doesn’t it?” Harry turned to go, the phœnix still on his shoulder, began slowly trudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm. And Hermione couldn’t leave it at that, she just couldn’t leave it at that. She didn’t know if it was her competition with Harry or something else. She just couldn’t leave it with the phœnix turning away from her. She had to— Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her excellent memory, found just one thing— “I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!” she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. “I mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid and courageous, right?” With a warbling cry the phœnix launched itself from Harry’s shoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her three times like she was the centre of an inferno, and for just a moment its wing brushed against her cheek, before the phœnix soared back to Harry. There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room. “Told you so,” Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing the stairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he was very light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a moment he and Fawkes were gone. Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had brushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that one small patch of skin had been very gently set on fire. She’d answered the question of the phœnix, she supposed, but it felt to her like she’d just barely squeaked by on the test, like she’d got 62 and she could’ve got 104 if she’d tried harder. If she’d tried at all. She hadn’t really been trying, when she thought about it. Just doing her homework— Who have you saved? 981 CH APTER 63 Aftermath, Draco Malfoy Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was straight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm that Father had taught him while other children were still playing in mud, a Charm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust would dirty his wizard’s robes. Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him, and tucked it into his robes. He had already used Incendio and Everto on the mysterious note. And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly the same tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, so that it would seem like all others had been waiting on his appearance to eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy you were first in every- thing, including breakfast, that was why. Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his pri- vate room, up even before he was—though not, of course, dressed quite as sharply. The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this early was heading straight to breakfast anyway. The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty and echoing. The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relatively few ar- rivals; some younger children crying, students running back and forth between tables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefect was standing in front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at them and Snape was striding toward the mess— The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some of the faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet. The food appeared on the tables. No-one looked at it. And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed straight toward Draco. A knot of fear clutched at Draco’s heart, had something happened to Father—no, surely Father would have told him—whatever was happen- ing, why hadn’t Father told him— There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape’s eyes, Draco saw as their Head of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharp dresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even dirtier and more disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra grease. “You haven’t heard?” hissed their Head of House as he came close. “For pity’s sake, Malfoy, don’t you have a newspaper delivered?” “What is it, Profe—” “Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!” “What?” said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said something he really shouldn’t have and Vincent just gasped. Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly. “Lucius told you nothing, then. I see.” Snape gave a snort, turned away— “Professor!” said Draco. The implications were just starting to dawn on him, his mind spinning frantically. “Professor, what should I do— Father didn’t instruct me—” “Then I suggest,” Snape said sneeringly, as he strode away, “that you tell them that, Malfoy, as your father intended!” Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn’t know why he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than he did. And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at the far end, which was still empty of sitters. Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with auto- matic motions. Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban. Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban…? Draco didn’t know what to make of that, it was as totally unexpected as the Sun going out—well, the Sun would expectedly go out in six billion years but this was as unexpected as the Sun going out tomorrow. Father wouldn’t have done it, Dumbledore wouldn’t have done it, no-one should have been able to do it—what did it mean—what use would Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in Azkaban—even if she got strong again, what use was a powerful sorceress who was completely evil and insane and fanati- cally devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn’t around any more? “Hey,” said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, “I don’t understand, boss, why’d we do that?” “We didn’t do it, you dolt!” snapped Draco. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, if even you think we—didn’t your father ever tell you any stories about Bel- latrix Black? She tortured Father once, she tortured your father, she’s tor- tured everyone, the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio herself and she did it! She didn’t do crazy things to inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things because she’s crazy! She’s a bitch is what she is!” “Oh, really?” said an incensed voice from behind Draco. Draco didn’t look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his back. “I would’ve thought you’d be happy—” “—to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!” Amycus Carrow had always been one of the other problem people; Fa- ther had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone in the same room with Amycus… Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they weren’t and yes, that mattered. Draco said in their general direction, certainly not deigning to address them in particular, “There’s Death Eaters and then there’s Death Eaters,” and then turned back to his food. There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoes stormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table. It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them, vis- ibly out of breath, and said, “Mr Malfoy, did you hear?” “About Bellatrix Black?” said Draco. “Yeah—” “No, about Potter!” “What?” “Potter was going around with a phœnix on his shoulder last night, looking like he’d been dragged through ten leagues of mud, they say that the phœnix took him to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix and he fought a duel with her and they blew up half the fortress!” “What?” said Draco. “Oh, there is just no way that—” Draco stopped. He’d said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had started to notice a trend. Millicent ran off to tell someone else. “You don’t really think—” said Gregory. “I honestly don’t know any more,” said Draco. A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across from him and William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincent nudged him and said, “There.” Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall. Draco watched him closely. There was no alarm on Harry’s face as he saw, no surprise or shock, he just looked… It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he was trying to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn’t understand yet. Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table, saying “Stay behind,” and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry. Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turning toward the Ravenclaw table, and Draco— —gave Harry one quick look— —and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great Hall. It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the small stony nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone but it would create plausible deniability. “Quietus,” said Harry. “Draco, what—” Draco took the envelope out of his robes. “I have a message for you from Father.” “Huh?” said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and tore it open in a rather careless manner, and drew forth a sheet of parchment and un- folded it and— Harry gave a sharp intake of breath. Then Harry looked at Draco. Then Harry looked back down at the parchment. There was a pause. Harry said, “Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?” Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth— “I see he did,” said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he should’ve known better, only it had been hard to decide. “What are you going to tell him?” “That you were surprised,” said Draco. “Surprised,” Harry said flatly. “Yeah. Good. Tell him that.” “What is it?” said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry looking conflicted, “If you’re dealing with Father behind my back—” And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper. It said: I know it was you. “What the—” “I was going to ask you that,” said Harry. “Have you got any idea what’s up with your Dad?” Draco stared at Harry. Then Draco said, “Did you do it?” “What?” said Harry. “What possible reason would I—how would I—” “Did you do it, Harry?” “No!” Harry said. “Of course not!” Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn’t detected any hesitation or tremor. So Draco nodded, and said, “I’ve got no idea what Father’s thinking but it can’t, I mean it can’t possibly be good. And, um…people are also say- ing…” “What,” said Harry warily, “are they saying, Draco?” “Did a phœnix really take you to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix Black from escaping—” 987 CH APTER 63 988 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 989 CH APTER 63 Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to Transfiguration at 8 a.m., waiting, he’d at least managed to get some food into himself before facing the next disaster, Luna Lovegood… The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave himself a really hard mental kick. One more thing he hadn’t thought of, one more thing he really should have. The older boy’s green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there were red spots on them looking very much like small dots of fresh blood, and one corner of his mouth had the look of a place that had been cut and healed, by Episkey or some other minor medical Charm that didn’t quite erase all the damage. Lesath Lestrange’s face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and half- dried tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of still more on the way. “Quietus,” said the older boy, and then “Hominem Revelio” and some other things, while Harry thought frantically and without much luck. And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes, and slowly this time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees on the dusty classroom floor. Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched the dust, and Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless. Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, “My life is yours, my Lord, and my death as well.” “I,” Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was having trouble speaking, “I—” didn’t have anything to do with it, he should have been saying, should be saying right now, but then again innocent-Harry would have had trouble speaking too— “Thank you,” whispered Lesath, “thank you, my Lord, oh, thank you,” the sound of a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all Harry could see of him was the hair on the back of his head, nothing of his face. “I’m a fool, my Lord, an ungrateful bastard, unworthy to serve you, I cannot abase myself enough, for I—I shouted at you after you helped me, be- cause I thought you were refusing me, and I didn’t even realize until this morning that I’d been such a fool as to ask you in front of Longbottom—” “I didn’t have anything to do with it,” Harry said. (It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.) Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at Harry. “I understand, my Lord,” said the older boy, his voice wavering a little, “you do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown myself a fool…I only wanted to say to you, that I am not ungrateful, that I know it must have been hard enough to save only one person, that they’re alerted now, that you can’t—get Father—but I am not ungrateful, I will never be un- grateful to you again. If ever you have a use for this unworthy servant, call me wherever I am, and I will answer, my Lord—” “I was not involved in any way.” (But it got easier each time.) Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, “Am I dismissed from your presence, my Lord…?” “I am not your Lord.” Lesath said, “Yes, my Lord, I understand,” and pushed himself back up from the floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then backed away from Harry until he turned to open the classroom door. As Lesath’s hand touched the doorknob, he paused. Harry couldn’t see Lesath’s face, as the older boy’s voice said, “Did you send her to someone who would take care of her? Did she ask about me at all?” And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, “Please stop that. I was not involved in any way.” “Yes, my Lord, I’m sorry, my Lord,” said Lesath’s voice; and the Slythe- rin boy opened the door and went out and shut the door behind him. His feet sped up as he ran away, but not fast enough that Harry couldn’t hear him start sobbing. Would I cry? wondered Harry. If I knew nothing, if I was innocent, would I cry right now? Harry didn’t know, so he just kept looking at the door. And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, Yay, we completed a quest and got a minion— Shut up. If you ever want to vote on anything ever again…shut up. 992 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast ended and he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but in the end, Albus Dumbledore did make it. “Headmaster?” squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius Flitwick, as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat. “Mr Potter left a message for you.” The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms Profes- sor. “Mr Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair had been the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr Potter said that he wasn’t saying anything about anything else, just apologizing for that one part.” The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still did not speak. “Headmaster?” squeaked Filius. “Tell him I said thank you,” said Albus Dumbledore, “but that it is wiser to listen to phœnixes than to wise old wizards,” and sat down at his place three seconds before all the food vanished. Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall She was heading toward the infirmary, and Harry Potter was leaving it, when they passed each other. The look he gave her wasn’t angry. It wasn’t sad. It didn’t say much at all. It was like…like he was looking at her just long enough to make it clear that he wasn’t deliberately avoiding looking at her. And then he looked away before she could figure out what look to give him in return; as though he wanted to spare her that, as well. He didn’t say anything as he walked past her. Neither did she. What could there possibly be to say? 995 CH APTER 63 Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the ser- vices of a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody mis- trusted slightly less than average because Moody had refrained from re- porting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known hint to their location. When Moody had got the list back, he hadn’t bothered reading most of it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating back to an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark Wizard ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn’t in Britain or anywhere else he’d have to worry about silly rules. That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired the Eye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberated for a period of around two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved in on the power vacuum. He’d considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had de- cided against it after he realized that would be just what they were expecting. Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying the graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot gloomier, that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary tombstones, demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal that Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend what the Muggles were thinking on that score, if they were pretending to have wards, or what, and he had decided not to ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretence.) Moody didn’t actually need to turn to survey the graveyard. The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every direction around him, no matter where it was pointing. But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater like Se- verus Snape know that. Sometimes people called Moody ‘paranoid’. Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting Dark Wizards and then get back to him about that. Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in retrospect, to achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution— weighed up how much experience it had taken him to get good instead of lucky—and had begun to suspect that most people died before they got there. Moody had once expressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and figuring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die, on average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming ‘paranoid’. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn’t lying. Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark Lord had used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, and was now awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin the Wizarding War anew. Someone else might have reacted with incredulity. “I can’t believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing,” Mad-Eye Moody said with considerable acerbity. “D’you realize how long it’ll take me to do the grave of every ancestor of every Dark Wizard I’ve ever killed who could’ve been smart enough to make a horcrux? You’re not just now doing this one, are you?” “I re-dose this one every year,” Severus Snape said calmly, uncapping the third flask of what the man had claimed would be seventeen bottles, and beginning to wave his wand over it. “The other ancestral graves we’ve been able to locate were poisoned with only the long-lasting substances, since some of us have less free time than yourself.” Moody watched the fluid spiralling out of the vial and vanishing, to appear within the bones where marrow had once been. “But you think it’s worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing the bones.” “He does have other avenues to life, should he perceive this one blocked,” Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle. “And before you ask, it must be the original grave, the place of first burial, the bone re- moved during the ritual and not before. Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also there is no point in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would notice it had lost all potency.” “Who else knows about this trap?” Moody demanded. “You. Me. The Headmaster. No-one else.” Moody snorted. “Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that Mc- Gonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?” “Yes—” “If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual and that Albus told them, Voldie’ll figure that Albus told me, and Voldie knows I’d think of this.” Moody shook his head in disgust. “What’re these other ways Voldie could come back to life?” Snape’s hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, of course, the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less than nothing to Moody, it just marked you in his Eye’s sight as trying-to-hide), and the former Death Eater said, “You don’t need to know.” “You’re learning, son,” said Moody with mild approval. “What’s in the bottles?” Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin the sub- stance flowing toward the grave, and said, “This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind of Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection potion, I suspect its effects will be permanent.” “What does it do?” said Moody. “It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone who has not used it,” drawled Snape, “and I have not used it.” Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. “What about that one?” “Love potion.” “Love potion?” said Moody. “Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond with an unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other.” “Gah!” said Moody. “That bloody sentimental fool—” “Agreed,” Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on his work. “Tell me you’ve at least got some Malaclaw venom in there.” “Second flask.” “Iocane powder.” “Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.” “Bahl’s Stupefaction,” Moody said, naming an extremely addictive narcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tenden- cies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the further effort to lay a second Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on a second touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what could have possibly been going through the man’s mind at the time he had cast the second Portus. “Tenth vial,” said Snape. “Basilisk venom,” offered Moody. “What?” spat Snape. “Snake venom is a positive component of the res- urrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve the bone and all the other substances! And where would we even get—” “Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be trusted.” Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning, surveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued pouring. “Hold on,” Moody said suddenly. “How do you know this is really where—” “Because it says ‘Tom Riddle’ on the easily moved headstone,” Snape said dryly. “And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, who bet you would think of that before the fifth bottle. So much for constant vigilance.” There was a pause. “How long did it take Albus to reali—” “Three years after we learned of the ritual,” said Snape, in a tone not quite like his usual sardonic drawl. “In retrospect, we should have con- sulted you earlier.” Snape uncapped the ninth bottle. “We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting sub- stances,” remarked the former Death Eater. “It is possible that we are in the correct graveyard. He may not have planned this far ahead back when he was slaughtering his family, and he cannot move the grave itself—” “The true location doesn’t look like a graveyard any more,” Moody said flatly. “He moved all the other graves here and Memory-Charmed the Mug- gles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told anything about that until just before the ritual started. No-one knows the true location now except him.” They continued their futile work. Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis “You doing anything interesting today?” said Tracey. “Nope,” said Daphne. 1001 CH APTER 63 1002 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1003 CH APTER 63 1004 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1005 CH APTER 63 1006 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1007 CH APTER 63 1008 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1009 CH APTER 63 1010 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1011 CH APTER 63 1012 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS 1013 CH APTER 63 1014 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes of breath and looked up from her copy of Beauxbatons: A History to see the missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced at lunch that Sunday, whose dinner non-appearance had been accompanied by rumours—and she hadn’t believed them because they were completely ridiculous, but she’d felt a little queasiness inside—that he’d withdrawn from Hogwarts in or- der to hunt down Bellatrix Black. “Harry!” she shrieked, she didn’t even realize that she was talking di- rectly to him for the first time in a week, or notice how some other stu- dents started at the sound of her yelling all the way across the Ravenclaw common room. Harry’s eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking toward her, so she stopped halfway out of her chair— A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he was putting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around them. (And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like they were watching.) “Hey,” Harry said. His voice wavered. “I missed you. You’re…going to talk to me again, now?” Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn’t think of what to say. She’d missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty sort of feeling, that it might’ve been a lot worse for him. She had other friends, Harry…it didn’t feel fair, sometimes, that Harry talked to only her like that, so that she had to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair things had been happening to him, too. “What’s been going on?” she said. “There’s all sorts of rumours. There were people saying you’d run off to fight Bellatrix Black, there were people saying you’d run off to join Bellatrix Black—” and those rumours had said that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phœnix, and she’d yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so then the next rumour had claimed she’d made up that part too, which was stupidity of such an inconceivable level that it left her completely flabbergasted. “I can’t talk about it,” Harry said in a bare whisper. “Can’t talk about a lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything,” his voice wavered, “but I can’t… I guess, if it helps or anything, I’m not going to lunch with Professor Quir- rell any more…” Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes. Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach. “Are you crying?” said Hermione. “Yeah,” said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. “I don’t want anyone else to see.” There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she didn’t know what to do about a boy crying, and she didn’t know what was happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her—no, around Harry— and if she knew what they were she would probably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she didn’t know anything. “Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?” she said at last. “That’s not why I can’t go to lunch with him any more,” Harry said, still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his eyes. “That was the Headmaster’s decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some things to me that made me trust him less, I guess…” Harry’s voice sounded very shaky. “I’m feeling kind of alone right now.” Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her yesterday. She’d kept thinking about that touch, over and over, maybe be- cause she wanted it to be important, to mean something to her… “Is there any way I can help?” she said. “I want to do something normal,” Harry said from behind his hands. “Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students. Something eleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are supposed to do. Like play a game of Exploding Snap or something…I don’t suppose you have the cards or know the rules or anything like that?” “Um…I don’t know the rules, actually…” said Hermione. “I know they explode.” “I don’t suppose Gobstones?” said Harry. “Don’t know the rules and they spit at you. Those are boy games, Harry!” There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to wipe it, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at her, looking a little helpless. “Well,” Harry said, “what do wizards and witches our age do, when they play, you know, the kind of pointless silly games we’re supposed to play at this age?” “Hopscotch?” said Hermione. “Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? I don’t know, I read books!” Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with him even though she didn’t know quite why, but it was funny. “I guess that helped a little,” said Harry. “Actually I think it helped more than playing Gobstones for an hour could’ve possibly helped, so thanks for being you. And no matter what, I’m not having anyone Obliviate everything I know about calculus. I’d sooner die.” “What?” said Hermione. “Why—why would you ever want to do that?” Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored back- ground noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. “I’m a tad sleepy so I’m going off to bed,” Harry said, now his voice was ordinary and wry, “I’ve got some lost time to make up for, but I’ll see you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that’s all right. Not to mention it wouldn’t be fair to dump all my depression on you. G’night, Hermione.” “Good night, Harry,” she said, feeling very confused and alarmed. “Pleasant dreams.” Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued on to- ward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys’ dorms. 1018 THE STANFORD PRISON EX PERIME NT, AFTERMATHS He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he’d yet to scream this night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from where his sleeping form had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying to get away from the gaps in space that were pursuing him through a corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn’t known, in the dream, that touching those voids meant he would die horribly and leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he’d known was that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world sliding after him— Harry started to cry again, it wasn’t for the horror of the chase, it was that he’d run away while someone behind him was screaming for help, screaming for him to come back and save her, help her, she was being eaten, she was going to die, and in the dream Harry had run away instead of helping her. “DON’T GO!” The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door. “No, no, no, don’t go, don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t—” Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He’d walked away. Fawkes should hate him. Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. He’d walked away. Fawkes should hate everyone— The boy wasn’t awake, wasn’t dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled and confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unpro- tected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain had woken up enough to think, but something else was too sleepy to act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his self-concept, his waking self’s ideals of what he shouldn’t think. That was the freedom of his brain’s dreams, as his self- concept slept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry’s new worst nightmare: “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” “No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die!” A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot wrath / icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her / for himself, and in his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways out of the moral dilemma, he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangu- lar horror of Azkaban, and whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and there was a blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore apart all the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal walls of Azka- ban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim orange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that there were people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the prisoners laughing as they flew away in flocks from the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver light restoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started crying harder into his pillow, because he couldn’t do it, because he wasn’t God— He’d sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist, he’d sworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he’d given his oath so now he had to do something, had to do something, had to do something— Maybe it was pointless. Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless. Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however. And in fact he’d sworn he’d do it, so now that was what he had to do. He’d just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was all. If that meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a spell to whisper that would echo all across the sky, whatever, the important thing was to destroy Azkaban. That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it was done. His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before accepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt like enough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep again, and dream the next nightmare. 1021 CH APTER 63 102 2 1023 1025 CH APTER 6 5 1026 CONTAGIOUS LIES 1027 CH APTER 6 5 1028 CONTAGIOUS LIES Knock-knock, knock-knock. “Come in, Mr Potter,” she said. The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the open- ing into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with one hand, and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that now stood in front of her desk. She’d Transfigured that chair so often that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without any wand movement or incan- tation or even conscious intent. Right now, that chair had become deeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat down he sank into it, as though the chair were hugging him. Harry didn’t seem to notice. There was an air of quiet determination about the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with hers, and not let up for a moment. “You called me?” said the boy. “I did,” said Professor McGonagall. “I have two pieces of good news for you, Mr Potter. First—have you met Mr Rubeus Hagrid, at all? The grounds-keeper? He was an old friend of your parents.” Harry hesitated. Then, “Mr Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got here,” Harry said. “I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of school. He didn’t say he knew my parents, though. At the time I thought he just wanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived…did he have some kind of hid- den agenda? He didn’t seem like the type…” “Ah…” she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts together. “It’s a long story, Mr Potter, but Mr Hagrid was falsely accused of mur- dering a student, five decades ago. Mr Hagrid’s wand was snapped, and he was expelled. Later, when Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr Hagrid a place here as Keeper of Grounds and Keys.” Harry’s eyes watched her intently. “You said that five decades ago was the last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were certain that five decades ago was the last time someone heard the Sorting Hat’s secret mes- sage.” She felt a slight chill—even the Headmaster or Severus might not have made that connection that quickly—and said, “Yes, Mr Potter. Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not believed, and Mr Ha- grid was blamed for the resulting death. However, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on the Sorting Hat, and he has shown it to a special panel of the Wizengamot. As a result, Mr Hagrid’s sentence has been revoked—just this morning, in fact—and he will be allowed to acquire a new wand.” She hesitated. “We…have not yet told Mr Hagrid of this, Mr Potter. We were waiting until the deed was done, so as not to give him false hope after so long. Mr Potter…we were wondering if we could tell Mr Hagrid that it was you who helped him…?” She saw the weighing look in his eyes— “I remember Mr Hagrid holding you when you were a baby,” she said. “I think he would be very happy to know.” She could see it, though, on Harry’s face, the moment when he de- cided that Rubeus wouldn’t be any use to him. Harry shook his head. “Bad enough that someone might deduce there was a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of students,” Harry said. “I think it’d be more prudent to just keep it all as secret as possible.” She remembered James and Lily, who’d never hesitated to return the friendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that James was the scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms Mistress, and Rubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been snapped… “Because you don’t expect him to prove useful, Mr Potter?” There was silence. She hadn’t intended to say that out loud. Sadness crossed Harry’s face. “Probably,” Harry said quietly. “But I don’t think he and I would get along, do you?” Something seemed to be stuck in her throat. “Speaking of making use of people,” Harry said. “It seems I’m going to be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So while I’m in your office, I’d like to ask that my sleep cycle be extended to thirty hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start practising duelling, there’s an older Hufflepuff who offered to teach him, and they invited me to join. Plus there’s other things I want to learn too—and if you or the Headmas- ter think I should study anything in particular, in order to become a pow- erful wizard when I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfrey to administer the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs to do—” “Mr Potter!” Harry’s eyes gazed directly into her own. “Yes, Minerva? I know it wasn’t your idea, but I’d like to survive the use the Headmaster’s making of me. Please don’t be an obstacle to that.” It almost broke her. “Harry,” she whispered in a bare voice, “children shouldn’t have to think like that!” “You’re right, they shouldn’t,” Harry said. “A lot of children have to grow up too early, though, not just me; and most children like that would probably trade places with me in five seconds. I’m not going to pity my- self, Professor McGonagall, not when there are people out there in real trouble and I’m not one of them.” She swallowed, hard, and said, “Mr Potter, at thirty hours per day, you’ll—get older, you’ll age faster—” Like Albus. “And in my fifth year I’ll be around the same physiological age as Her- mione,” said Harry. “Doesn’t seem that terrible.” There was a wry smile now on Harry’s face. “Honestly, I’d probably want this even if there weren’t a Dark Lord. Wizards live for a while, and either wizards or Muggles will probably push that out even further over the next century. There’s no rea- son not to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I’ve got things I plan to do, and ‘twere well they were done quickly.” There was a long pause. “All right,” Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She raised her voice. “All right, Mr Potter, I shall ask the Headmaster, and if he agrees, it shall be done.” Harry’s eyes narrowed for a moment. “I see. Then please remind the Headmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that if it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn’t tell anyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts.” And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus stop- ping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into nothingness. That was what Albus had told her when she’d objected that Cameron Edward was too young, and then when she’d objected that Peter Pevensie was too young, and finally she’d given up objecting. “Who told you that, Mr Pot- ter?” Not Albus—surely Albus would never say that to any student— “I’ve been doing a lot of reading lately,” Harry said. His body started to rise from the enveloping chair, then halted. “Dare I ask about the second piece of good news?” “Oh,” she said. “Ah—Professor Quirrell has woken up and says that you may—” 1032 CONTAGIOUS LIES 1033 CH APTER 6 5 1034 CONTAGIOUS LIES In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed above a white hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of its eyes. “So,” Harry said finally. “Let uss be clear on what iss propossed. You ssuggesst that we sset up imposstor to imperssonate Dark Lord.” “Something like that. Woman we resscued will cooperate, sshould be mosst con- vincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss sside.” More sardonic tongue-flickering. “You are kidnapped from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess, wardss keep out protectorss.

Nobody will believe Dark Lord could posssibly be that sstupid—” “You and I are only two people in country who would notice that,” hissed the snake. “Trusst me on thiss, boy.” “What if there iss third, ssome day?” The snake swayed thoughtfully. “Could write different sscript for play, if you wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open posssibility Dark Lord might return yet again—nation musst think they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.” Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake’s eyes. “Well?” hissed the swaying form. The obvious thought was that going along with the Defence Profes- sor’s plots and deceptions a second time, spinning an even more compli- cated lie to cover up the first mistake, and creating another fatal vulnera- bility if anyone ever discovered the truth, would be exactly the same sort of stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing Curse again. It didn’t even take his Hufflepuff side to point that out, Harry thought it in his very own mental voice. But there was also a certain question as to whether the appropriate moral to learn from the last experience was to always say no immediately to the Defence Professor, or… “Will think about it,” hissed Harry. “Will not ansswer right away, thiss time, will enumerate risskss and benefitss firsst—” “Undersstood,” hissed the snake. “But remember thiss, boy, other eventss pro- ceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.” 1037 CH APTER 6 5 1038 1039 CH APTER 6 6 1040 SELF ACTUALIZATION I Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her (except on the day of the phœnix, the day Bellatrix Black had escaped, which shouldn’t count for anyone). The Hufflepuff girl had come over to the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped Hermione on her shoul- der, and very nearly dragged her away— “Neville and Harry Potter are learning duelling from Mr Diggory!” Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from the table. “Who?” said Hermione. “Cedric Diggory!” said Hannah. “He’s the Captain of our Quidditch Team, and general of an army, and he’s taking all the electives and getting better grades than anyone, and I hear he learns duelling from professional tutors during the summers, and he once beat two seventh- year students, and even some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor Sprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something like that, and—” After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a while), Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise. “Sunshine Soldier Abbott!” said Hermione. “Calm down. We’re not go- ing to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville’s studying to beat us, but we can study too—” “Don’t you see?” Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a lot louder than it should’ve been, if they were trying to keep the conversation private from all the Ravenclaws looking at them. “Neville isn’t studying to beat us! He’s practising so he can fight Bellatrix Black! They’re going to go through us like a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!” The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. “Listen,” said Hermione, “I don’t think a few weeks of practice is going to make anyone an invinci- ble fighter. Plus we already know how to handle invincible fighters. We’ll concentrate fire on them and they’ll go down just like Draco.” The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and skepticism. “Aren’t you even, you know, worried?” “Oh, honestly!” said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard being the only sensible person in your whole school year. “Haven’t you ever heard the saying, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?” “What?” said Hannah. “That’s crazy, what about Lethifolds lurking in the darkness, and being put under the Imperius Curse, and horrible Transfiguration accidents and—” “I mean,” said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into her now-raised voice, she’d been hearing this sort of thing all week now, “how about if we wait until after the Chaos Legion actually crushes us to get so scared of them and did you just mutter ‘Gryffindors’ under your voice?” A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at the table with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it wasn’t the ter- rible cold glare of Harry’s dark side but it was the scariest face she knew how to make. Harry Potter was going down. 1043 1045 CH APTER 67 1046 SELF ACTUALIZATION II Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the corridors, Harry watching the yellow-golden compass that pointed toward the loca- tion of the Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a lookout just in case they ran into someone else. Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened closely. “So,” the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. “That’s why you had us practise duelling with all that weight strapped on?” Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to Sunshine; if the apparent direction started to change quickly then they were getting close. “I didn’t want to say anything in front of the others, but a couple of weeks isn’t a lot of time to put on extra muscle,” said Neville. “And the bal- ance is different, and I think this weighs more actually, and doesn’t this count as Transfiguring a Muggle artefact?” “Nope,” Harry said. “I checked that in advance. You can see it in Hog- warts statues, so some wizards used to wear it, even if they were just being fashionable for the Dark Ages.” And since nobody would ever try this if they weren’t fighting first-year students using weak spells like the Sleep Hex, it didn’t count as giving away good ideas, either. They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor bent in quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept course toward where Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos Legion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the better of the two op- tions, and Neville followed. “We’d better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we get close,” Neville said. “It’s kind of noisy, they might figure it out.” Harry nodded, and then said “Good idea” in case Neville hadn’t been looking at him. They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upper reach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass, now and then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the occasional wizard-knight in plate armour or chain mail. 1048 SELF ACTUALIZATION II 1049 CH APTER 67 The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over their faces, stood facing Sunshine’s entire army, seemingly undaunted by a dozen Sleep Hexes. Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head turned she saw that Hannah’s lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff girl’s eyes were huge, and she was staring at— It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts that flashed through Daphne’s mind as she realized that Hannah was staring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to trigger some part of her into noticing that in point of fact Neville had been getting pretty inter- esting lately as boys went, in fact right now the Last Scion of Longbottom was seeming downright cool, and something woke up inside her and her own lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother had ever instructed her about demure demeanour and flattery and scented shampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should have fluffed her hair about her ears, because she’d watched Hermione and Harry and she knew how she wanted her own courtship to go— Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells it might be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. Daphne’s wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted “Tonare!” The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation “Ravum Calvaria!” And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked, “Lucis Gladius!” The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she bore it, and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized the drain was a little less. Still, she had a feeling she’d better not try to fight with this for long. That everyone was staring at her went quite without saying, and she should have leaped forward to confront Neville with her hair billowing around her, but it was all she could do to walk forward steadily to level her Most Ancient Blade at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside and made way for her also went without saying. “I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass!” she cried. “Greengrass of Sunshine!” The duelling forms had gone completely out of her mind, she’d seen enough plays to remember death challenges and blood challenges but she couldn’t remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she just pointed the incandescent sword toward the object of her crush and yelled, “Let’s see what you got, Nevvy!” Once again Harry’s voice shrieked “Stupefy!”, and later on, when she was remembering this, she could never quite believe she’d managed to do it, but she slashed out with her blade of light like it was a Beater’s bat, and hit the stun bolt back at Harry who just barely managed to twist out of the way. “Tonare!” shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Longbottom. “Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!” 1051 CH APTER 67 1052 SELF ACTUALIZATION II 1053 CH APTER 67 “Somnium!” shrieked Draco, and then after only a few seconds to recharge, “Somnium, curse you!” He knew he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn’t even trying to dodge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly as his father and levelled his wand— Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said “Somnium!” but Draco was getting winded, he couldn’t keep this up, Theodore wasn’t both- ering to dodge at all while Draco had to keep moving, this was crazy. He had enough strength now to fire again, but— Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result, Harry had said, this was Harry’s work somehow, it couldn’t be a Muggle artefact any more but Draco couldn’t figure out what it could be, and he should be thinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy fran- tically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex at him, Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he twisted, that had been a very very near miss and finally Draco couldn’t take it any more, he didn’t bother working out what theory he was testing or why as he just— “Luminos!” shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in red light, “Du- lak!” and it went out again (so Theodore was still being affected by magic), “Expelliarmus!” and Theodore’s wand went flying (that had been a good spell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but Theodore was rush- ing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to grapple so Draco yelled “Flipendo!” and the other boy’s feet were abruptly yanked up— —and Theodore’s back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud and metallic-sounding crash. Draco’s vision was swimming now from casting four spells in such fast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet, so there wasn’t even time to think in words, but Draco still managed to say “Som- nium!” and this time he aimed for Theodore’s face instead of the chest. Theodore dodged (he dodged!) and the boy shouted “Code seven on Mal- foy!” “Prismatis!” cried Padma’s voice and there was suddenly a shimmer- ing rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four Chaotic voices cried “Som- nium!” And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge Prismatic Sphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army. Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees, but he looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, “If the Sleep Hex—doesn’t work—aim for the face—I think the Lieutenants are wear- ing metal shirts.” “You’ve already lost too many soldiers,” Finnigan said loudly from across the barrier, “we’ll beat you anyway,” and then the Gryffindor boy laughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as well as Harry Potter by now, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires started laughing with him soon afterwards. Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and Vin- cent lay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic Sphere, the largest one he’d ever seen her cast; but she was breathing hard, still vis- ibly sweaty from when they’d all jogged to get into position, the Ravenclaw girl was a strong witch but not an athletic one. He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos from be- hind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Draco could guess where they’d gone, but two soldiers couldn’t delay the whole Sun- shine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could they? 1055 CH APTER 67 1056 1057 CH APTER 68 1058 SELF ACTUALIZATION III 1059 CH APTER 68 She left the Defence Professor’s office with a larger army, and less dig- nity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just been squished, and trying very very hard not to cry. “I wasn’t holding back!” Harry said as soon as they turned the first cor- ner away from Professor Quirrell’s office, the moment the wooden door faded out of sight behind the stone walls. “I wasn’t pretending, I never let either of you win!” She didn’t answer, couldn’t answer, it would all break loose if she tried to say a word. “Really?” said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that air of resignation. “Because Quirrell’s right, you know, it’s suspicious that you could beat nearly everyone in both our armies as soon as you wanted to make us chase you onto the roof. And didn’t you say something then, Pot- ter, about us needing to beat you when you were fighting for real?” The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when it reached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she would be just a crying little girl to both of them. “That—” Harry’s voice said urgently, she wasn’t looking at him but his voice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. “That was—I tried a lot harder that time, there was an important reason, I had to, so I used a whole bunch of tricks I’d been saving up—and—” She’d always been trying her hardest, every time. “—and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn’t usually use for something like Defence class—” So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it really mat- tered, he could just go into his dark side and crush her, was that it? …of course it was. She couldn’t even look Harry in the eyes when he was being scary, how had she ever thought she could beat him for real? The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left to- ward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went right in- stead, she didn’t even know where that passage went but right now she’d rather be lost in the castle. “Excuse me, Draco,” said Harry’s voice, and then there was a pattering of footsteps behind her. “Leave me alone,” she said, it came out sounding stern but then she had to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and hold her breath to stop it all from coming out. That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himself in front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry said, his voice now a high and desperate whisper, “I didn’t run away when you were beating me in all my classes except broomstick riding!” He didn’t understand, and he would never understand, Harry Potter would never understand, because no matter what contest he lost he would still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter and Hermione Gran- ger was beating you then it meant everyone was expecting you to rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione Granger and Harry Potter was beat- ing you that meant you were just no-one. “It’s not fair,” she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn’t crying yet, not yet, “I shouldn’t have to fight your dark side, I’m just—I’m only—” I’m only twelve, that was what she thought then. “I only used my dark side once and that was—when I had to!” “So today you beat my whole army being just Harry?” She still wasn’t crying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like right now, if she looked like an angry Hermione or a sad one. “I—” Harry said. His voice got a little lower, “I wasn’t…really expecting to win, that time, I know I said I was invincible but that was just to try to scare you, I really just thought we’d slow you down for a bit—” She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she passed Harry’s face tightened up like he was going to cry. “Is Professor Quirrell right?” came a high desperate whisper from be- hind her. “If I have you for a friend, will I always be afraid to do better because I know it will hurt your feelings? That’s not fair, Hermione!” She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across the stone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with her vision all blurry, ran so that no-one would hear her, and this time Harry didn’t follow. 1062 SELF ACTUALIZATION III Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a revolving he- lix that shouldn’t have taken her anywhere at all, and instead bore her con- tinuously upward. Hermione thought it seemed like the Enchantment of the Endless Stair, which had been invented in 1733 by the wizard Arram Sabeti who’d lived on top of Mount Everest in the days when no Muggles could climb it. Only that couldn’t be right because Hogwarts was much older—maybe the enchantment had been reinvented? She should’ve been frightened, should’ve been nervous about her sec- ond meeting with the Headmaster. She was, in fact, frightened and nervous about her second meeting with the Headmaster. Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she’d been thinking a lot, after she hadn’t been able to run any further and had slid down against the wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she curled up in a ball with her back against the chilly stone wall and her legs drawn up and crying. Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to lose to Draco Malfoy, that was just totally absolutely unacceptable, and Professor Quirrell had praised General Malfoy for not ignoring his thousand alterna- tives; and so after Hermione had cried herself out she’d thought of four- teen other spells she should’ve tried against Harry and Neville, and then she’d started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistake about other things; and that was how she’d ended up knocking on Profes- sor McGonagall’s door. Not asking for help, right now Hermione didn’t have any plans she could ask for help with, just telling Professor McGon- agall everything, because when she’d thought of it that had seemed like one of the thousand alternatives that Professor Quirrell had been talking about. And she’d told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter had changed since the day the phœnix had been on his shoulder, and about how people more and more seemed to see her as just something of Harry’s, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and farther away from everyone else in their school year and went around with a sad air sometimes like he was losing something, and she didn’t know what to do any more. And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk to the Headmaster. And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come to her that Harry Potter wouldn’t have been scared of the Headmaster. Harry Potter would have just barged ahead doing whatever he was trying to do. Maybe (the thought had come to her) it was worth trying to be like that, not being scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her, it couldn’t really be worse. The Endless Stair stopped turning. The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin knocker opened without being touched. Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in every di- rection, looking like it had drawers set inside other drawers, was the silver- bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his throne, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently twinkling eyes Hermione looked for around three seconds before she was distracted by all the other things in the room. Some time later—she wasn’t sure how long but it was while she was trying to count the number of things in the room for the third time and still not getting the same answer, even though her memory insisted that nothing had been added or removed—the Headmaster cleared his throat and said, “Miss Granger?” Hermione’s head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in her cheeks; but Dumbledore didn’t appear annoyed with her at all, only serene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed eyes. “Hermione,” said Professor McGonagall, the older witch’s voice was gentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione’s shoulder, “please tell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry.” Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution her voice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described how Harry had changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been on his shoulder. When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmaster sighed. “I am sorry, Hermione Granger,” said Dumbledore. Those blue eyes had grown sadder as she spoke. “That is…unfortunate, but I cannot say it is unexpected. That is a hero’s burden, which you see.” “A hero?” said Hermione. She looked up nervously at Professor McGon- agall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor’s face had grown tight, though her hand still squeezed Hermione’s shoulder reassuringly. “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I was a hero myself once, before I was a mys- terious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald. You have read history books, Miss Granger?” Hermione nodded. “Well,” said Dumbledore, “that is what heroes have to do, Miss Gran- ger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to accomplish them, and that is what you see happening to Harry. If there is anything that can be done to gentle his pathway, then you will be the one to do it, and not I. For I am not Harry’s friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard.” “I—” said Hermione. “I’m not sure—I still want to be—” Her voice stopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud. Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked a little older than before. “No-one can stop you, Miss Granger, if you choose to stop being Harry’s friend. As for what it would do to him, you may know that better than I.” “That—doesn’t seem fair,” Hermione said, her voice trembling. “That I’ve got to be Harry’s friend because he’s got no-one else? That doesn’t seem fair.” “Being a friend is not something you can be forced to, Miss Granger.” The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. “The feelings are there, or they are not. If they are there, you can accept them or deny them. You are Harry’s friend—and choosing to deny it would wound him terribly, perhaps beyond healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to such extremes?” She couldn’t find words. She’d never been able to find words. “If you get too near Harry—you get swallowed up, and no-one sees you any more, you’re just something of his, everyone thinks the whole world revolves around him and…” She didn’t have the words. The old wizard nodded slowly. “It is indeed an unjust world we live in, Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who defeated Grindel- wald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died opening the way so I could pass through. And yet she is remembered. Harry Potter is the hero of this play, Miss Granger; the world does revolve around him. He is destined for great things; and I ween that in time the name of Albus Dumbledore will be remembered as Harry Potter’s mysterious old wizard, more than for anything else I have done. And perhaps the name of Hermi- one Granger will be remembered as his companion, if you prove worthy of it in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find more glory on your own, than in Harry Potter’s company.” Hermione shook her head rapidly. “But that’s not—” She’d known she wouldn’t be able to explain. “It’s not about glory, it’s about being— something that belongs to someone else!” “So you think you would rather be the hero?” The old wizard sighed. “Miss Granger, I have been a hero, and a leader; and I would have been a thousand times happier if I could have belonged to someone like Harry Potter. Someone made of sterner stuff than I, to make the hard decisions, and yet worthy to lead me. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, but I was mistaken…Miss Granger, you have no idea at all how fortunate are those like you, compared to heroes.” The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, along with helplessness, she didn’t understand why Professor McGonagall had brought her here if the Headmaster wasn’t going to help, and from a glance at Professor McGonagall’s face, it looked like Professor McGonagall also wasn’t sure now that it had been a good idea. “I don’t want to be a hero,” said Hermione Granger, “I don’t want to be a hero’s companion, I just want to be me.” (The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she did in fact want to be a hero, but she decided not to change what she’d said.) “Ah,” said the old wizard. “That is a tall order, Miss Granger.” Dum- bledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and pointed to a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione’s eyes had glossed right over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed the heraldry of Hog- warts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven, and in Latin engraved words whose point she’d never understood. Then, as she realized where that shield was, and how old it looked, it suddenly occurred to Hermione that this might be the original— “A Hufflepuff would say,” said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on the faded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it was the original), “that people fail to become who they are meant to be, because they are too lazy to put in all the work involved. A Ravenclaw,” tapping the raven, “would repeat those words that the wise know to be far older than Socrates, know thyself, and say that people fail to become who they are meant to be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And Salazar Sly- therin,” Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded snake, “why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by following our desires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that people fail to become them- selves because they refuse to do what is necessary to achieve their am- bitions. But then one notes that nearly all of the Dark Wizards to come out of Hogwarts have been Slytherins. Did they become what they were meant to be? I think not.” Dumbledore’s finger tapped the lion, and then he turned toward her. “Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you that House.” It didn’t seem like a hard question. “A Gryffindor would say that people don’t become who they should be, because they’re afraid.” “Most people are afraid, Miss Granger,” said the old wizard. “They live their whole lives circumscribed by crippling fear that cuts off everything they might accomplish, everything they might become. Fear of saying or doing the wrong thing, fear of losing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all the fear of what other people will think of them. Such fear is a most terrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important to know that. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. People become who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is right.” The old wizard’s voice was gentle. “So tell me, Miss Granger, what seems to you like the right choice? For that is who you truly are, and wherever that path leads, that is who you are meant to become.” There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that could not be counted. She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw. “I don’t think it’s right,” Hermione said slowly, “for someone to have to live inside someone else’s shadow like that…” “Many things in the world are not right,” said the old wizard, “the ques- tion is what is right for you to do about them. Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot imagine how badly things could go if the events surround- ing Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you would not even dream of walking away from, if you knew.” “What quest?” said Hermione. Her voice was trembling, because it was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking for and she didn’t want to give it. “What happened to Harry back then, why was Fawkes on his shoulder?” “He grew up,” said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several times, beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked very lined. “You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because of time, peo- ple grow up when they are placed in grown-up situations. That is what happened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told—you are not to share this information with anyone, you understand—he was told that he would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you who. I cannot tell you why. But that is what happened to him, and why he needs his friends.” There was a pause. “Bellatrix Black?” Hermione said. She couldn’t have been more shocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into her ear. “You’re going to make Harry fight Bellatrix Black?” “No,” said the old wizard. “Not her. I cannot tell you who, or why.” She thought about it some more. “Is there any way I can keep up with Harry?” said Hermione. “I mean, I’m not saying it’s what I’ll do, but—if he needs friends then can we be equal friends? Can I be a hero too?” “Ah,” said the old wizard, and smiled. “Only you can decide that, Miss Granger.” “But you’re not going to help me like you’re helping Harry.” The old wizard shook his head. “I have helped him little enough, Miss Granger. And if you are asking me for a quest—” The old wizard smiled again, rather wryly. “Miss Granger, you are in your first year of Hogwarts. Do not be too eager to grow up; there will be time enough for that later.” “I’m twelve. Harry’s eleven.” “Harry Potter is special,” said the old wizard. “As you know, Miss Gran- ger.” The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the half-moon glasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor when Dumbledore’s voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew about Harry’s dark side. Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall’s hand, which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and Hermione said, she was surprised that her voice didn’t break, “I’d like to go, now, please.” “Of course,” said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the hand on her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken door. “Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?” said Albus Dum- bledore’s voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creaked open to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair. She nodded. “And?” “I’ll,” she said, her voice stuck, “I’ll, I’ll—” She swallowed. “I’ll do—what’s right—” She didn’t say anything else, she couldn’t, and then the Endless Stair began revolving around her once again. Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down. When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and the two of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts, Professor Mc- Gonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, “I’m so terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I did not think the Headmaster would say such things to you. I think he truly has forgotten what it is like to be a child.” Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor McGonagall looked like she was about to burst into tears…only not really, but there was a tightness in her face that was like that. “If I want to be a hero too,” said Hermione, “if I’ve decided to be a hero too, is there anything you can do to help?” Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, “Miss Gran- ger, I’m not sure the Headmaster is wrong about that. You are twelve.” “Okay,” said Hermione. They walked forward a bit. “Excuse me,” said Hermione, “is it okay if I walk back to the Ravenclaw tower by myself? I’m sorry, it’s not your fault or anything, I just want to be by myself right now.” “Of course, Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, her voice sounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop, and then turn around behind her. Hermione Granger walked away. She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if there was anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be a hero. Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor McGonagall, and even if he didn’t, he probably couldn’t help, Hermione didn’t know who could help. Well, Professor Quirrell would come up with something clever if she used up enough Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a bad idea—that the Defence Professor couldn’t help anyone become the sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that he wouldn’t even understand the difference. She had almost reached the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the flash of gold. CHAPTER SIXT Y-NINE SE LF ACTUALIZATION, PART I V It was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw it, a reflec- tion on the polished metal of a statue at the junction of two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like an image of fire; just for a moment she saw it, and then it was gone. She paused, puzzled, and she almost walked away, but there had been something familiar about that brief glow— Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked at the corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have come. Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the call. Hermione started to run. She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would pause, catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a flash of fire re- flected from one direction or another, or hear that distant call. If it hadn’t been for her army training she would’ve fallen over in exhaustion, run- ning like that. She never saw the phœnix. And then she came to a four-way branch and there was nothing, no sign, she waited for long seconds and she heard no cry and saw no fire, and she was only just starting to wonder with a sick sad feeling if she’d imagined the whole thing, when she heard a person cry out. When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in the whole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes already turning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in yellow, who was dangling in the air from one foot held up high by an invisible hand. The Sunshine General didn’t even think about it, people who stopped to think didn’t spring very good ambushes. Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips said “Somnium!” and the largest bully fell over, the Hufflepuff boy dropped out of the air with a thump and the other two bullies were trying to aim their wands at her and she said “Somnium!” again and another huge boy keeled over—the one who’d been aiming his wand faster, that was who she’d fired at. Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was hard even for her, and she couldn’t get off a third before— The last bully shouted “Protego!” and was surrounded by a shimmering blue glow. Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a real Shielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells on her even while he was protected. Now she— “Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy. The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance, blazing far brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry’s wand. Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed, because the bully’s aim hadn’t been nearly as good as Harry’s; and the thought came to her that maybe bullies and Professor Quirrell’s armies didn’t mix. “Stupefy!” shouted the bully-boy again. “Expelliarmus! Stupefy!” Anyway, now she’d just spent a whole hour thinking of all the other spells she could’ve cast on Harry and Neville— “Jellify!” yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with no visible bolt to dodge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too weak to support her. And then, with an angry roar producing an even brighter blaze of crimson, “Stupefy!” She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she’d recov- ered enough for her next spell, which was— “Glisseo,” said Hermione, directing her remark to the floor. “Oof,” said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him and he actually dropped his wand. The Protego winked out. “Somnium,” said Hermione. She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where the Huf- flepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his skull where he’d been dropped head-first into the floor; it was a good thing he hadn’t been a Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might have snapped his neck. She hadn’t actually thought of that. “Uh,” said the boy, his hair was of a colour that would’ve been called ‘brunette’ if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished brown that some- how seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren’t any tears on his face but he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at about fourth year, or third. Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. “General Sunshine?” “Yeah,” she said. “That’s (gasp) me.” If the Hufflepuff boy said anything about her being Harry Potter’s love interest, she decided, he was going to die. “Wow,” said the Hufflepuff boy. “That was—you just—I mean I saw you on the screens before Christmas but—wow! I can’t believe you just did that!” There was a pause. I can’t believe I just did that, thought Hermione Granger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must have been all that running. “Excuse (gasp) me,” she said, “can you (gasp) Unjellify my legs?” The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside his robes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture before the counter-Jinx worked right. “I’m Michael Hopkins,” said the boy once Hermione had rolled back to her own feet. He stuck out his hand. “Or just Mike inside Hufflepuff, there aren’t any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this year, would you believe it?” They shook hands, and Mike said, “Anyway, thank you.” Hermione wasn’t prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her then, saving someone like that literally felt better than anything she’d ever felt in her whole life. She turned to look at the bullies. They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen years old, and she was suddenly realizing just how large a difference had sprung up between Hogwarts students who’d signed up for all of Professor Quir- rell’s extracurricular activities, and students who’d had years of being taught by the worst Professors ever to go Professing. Being able to hit things that you aimed at, for example; or being able to think well enough in the middle of a fight to realize that you ought to Innervate your fallen allies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said, like that in the real world almost any fight would be settled by a surprise attack, suddenly made a lot more sense to her. Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike. “Would you (gasp) believe,” said Hermione Granger, “that five minutes ago I was (gasp) having trouble figuring out how to become a (gasp) hero?” Had she really thought she needed permission from someone, or that heroes sat around waiting for someone else to give them quests? It was very simple actually, you just went where the evil was, that was all it ever took to be a hero. She should’ve remembered, she shouldn’t have needed a phœnix to tell her, that bad things sometimes happened right here in Hogwarts. Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older boys were lying unconscious as the realization hit that they’d seen her, they might know who she was, they might sneak up on her and take her by surprise and—and they could really hurt her— Hermione stopped. She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle of five Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when he hadn’t even known how to use his wand. She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by being put in grown-up situations, and that most people lived their lives inside a constraining circle of fear. And she remembered Professor McGonagall’s voice saying, ‘You are twelve.’ Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times. She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey’s office, which he didn’t; and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin boys, just in case. And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of uncon- scious bullies, making sure to put a smile on her face as she walked. She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or later. But if you were too scared of getting hurt to do what was right, then you couldn’t be a hero, it was as simple as that; and if you’d put the Sorting Hat on her head at that moment it wouldn’t have waited even one second before calling out ‘GRYFFINDOR!’ 1075 CH APTER 69 1076 SELF ACTUALIZATION I V “…and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems unshakeable,” Minerva said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded old wizard who was re- sponsible for this. Albus Dumbledore was just sitting silently and listen- ing to her with a distant sad look in his eyes. “Miss Granger didn’t even blink when Professor Flitwick threatened to have her transferred to Gryf- findor, just said that if she left she would take all the books with her. Her- mione Granger has decided she’s going to be a hero and she’s not taking no for an answer. I doubt you could have pushed her into this any harder if you had tried to—” It took all of five full seconds for Minerva’s brain to process the real- ization. “ALBUS!” she shrieked. “My dear,” said the old wizard, “after you have dealt with your thirti- eth hero or so, you will realize that they react quite predictably to certain things; such as being told that they are too young, or that they are not des- tined to be heroes, or that being a hero is unpleasant; and if you truly wish to be sure you should tell them all three. Although,” with a brief sigh, “it does not do to be too blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catch you.” “Albus,” Minerva said, her voice even tighter, “if she is hurt, I swear this time I’ll—” “She would have come to that same place in due time,” Albus said, the distant sad look still in his eyes. “If someone is meant to become a hero then they will not listen to our warnings, Minerva, no matter how hard we try. And given that, it is better for Harry if Miss Granger does not fall too far behind him.” Albus produced, as though from nowhere, a tin which flipped open to reveal small yellow lumps, she’d never been able to figure out where he kept it and she’d never been able to detect the magic involved. “Lemon drop?” “She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!” 1078 1079 CH APTER 69 1080 SELF ACTUALIZATION I V And thus was born the Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches. CHAPTER SE V ENT Y SE LF ACTUALIZATION, PART V Even if you had been the Deputy Headmistress for three decades, and a Transfiguration Professor before that, it was rare that you saw Albus Dumbledore completely wrong-footed. “…Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and Daphne Greengrass,” Min- erva finished. “I should also note, Albus, that Miss Granger’s account of your seemingly unsupportive attitude—I believe her phrase was ‘he said I should be happy to be just a sidekick’—has generated a good deal of interest among the older girls. Several of whom came to me to ask if Miss Granger’s accusations were true, since Miss Granger had said that I was there.” The old wizard leaned back in his huge chair, still gazing at her, his eyes looking rather abstracted beneath the half-moon glasses. “It placed me in something of a dilemma, Albus,” said Professor Mc- Gonagall. Her face stayed quite neutral, she made sure of that. “I now know that you did not truly mean to discourage the girl. Quite the oppo- site, in fact. But you and Severus have often told me that to keep a secret I must give no sign that differs from the reaction of someone truly ignorant. Thus I had no choice but to confirm that Miss Granger’s account was ac- curate, and feign the appropriate degree of worry, with a slight overtone of offense. After all, had I not known you were deliberately manipulating Miss Granger, I might have been rather put out.” “I…see,” the old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently with his silver beard, small quick gestures. “Thankfully,” Professor McGonagall continued, “so far Professors Sin- istra and Vector are the only two faculty members to don Miss Granger’s buttons.” “Buttons?” repeated the old wizard. Minerva drew forth a small silver disc bearing the initials sphew, laid it on Albus’s desk, and gave it a brief tap with her finger. And the voices of Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis cried out in unison, “We won’t settle for second best, it’s time to give a witch a quest!” “Miss Granger is selling them for two Sickles, and tells me that she has so far sold fifty of them. I believe that Nymphadora Tonks, in seventh-year Hufflepuff, is enchanting them for her. To conclude my report,” Profes- sor McGonagall said briskly, “our eight newly minted heroines have asked permission to conduct a protest outside the entrance to your office.” “I hope,” Albus said, frowning, “you explained to them that—” “I explained to them that Wednesday at 7 p.m. would be fine,” said Minerva. She took back the button from the Headmaster’s desk, favoured Albus with a honeyed smile, and turned to the door. “Minerva?” said the old wizard from behind her. “Minerva!” The oaken door shut solidly behind her. 1084 SELF ACTUALIZATION V 1085 CH APTER 70 1086 SELF ACTUALIZATION V 1087 CH APTER 70 1088 SELF ACTUALIZATION V 1089 CH APTER 70 109 0 SELF ACTUALIZATION V 1091 CH APTER 70 1092 SELF ACTUALIZATION V 1093 CH APTER 70 1094 SELF ACTUALIZATION V The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but to be honest their heart had gone out of it. It had been established, after some careful questions from Professor Flitwick, that Harry Potter hadn’t smelled the chicken burning. Which meant that it had probably been a pebble or something, Transfigured into a chicken and then enclosed in a Boundary Charm to make sure that no smoke escaped into the air—both Professor Flitwick and Professor Mc- Gonagall had been very emphatic about nobody trying that without their supervision. But still… But still…what? Hermione didn’t even know but still what. But still. After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom had wanted to be first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest over, and the adults and boys had drifted off. “You don’t think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?” said Susan as the heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs of feet tread- ing on the stone paving of Hogwarts’s corridors. “I mean, if he is crazy at everyone and not just at witches then it’s not discrimination, right?” “I don’t want to protest against the Headmaster any more,” Hannah said weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on her feet. “I don’t care what Professor McGonagall says about him not holding it against us, it’s just too much for my nerves.” Lavender snorted. “I guess you won’t be slaying armies of Inferi any- time soon—” “Stop that!” Hermione said sharply. “Look, all of us have got to learn to be heroines, right? It’s okay if someone doesn’t know how right away.” “The Headmaster doesn’t think it can be learned,” Padma said. The Ravenclaw girl’s face was thoughtful, her steps measured as she strode through the corridor. “The Headmaster doesn’t even think that’s a good idea.” Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held bolt upright, looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts robes than Hermione could have done with her best formal dress. “The Head- master,” Daphne said in a precise voice, her shoes making hard, sharp tacking sounds on the stone, “thinks the lot of us are a bunch of silly girls playing games, and that some day Hermione might make a good sidekick but the rest of us are hopeless.” “Is he right?” said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl’s face was very serious, making her look much more like her twin than she usually did. “I mean it has to be asked—” “No!” spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking through the hallway looking ready to kill someone, like a miniature female Snape. Of all the girls, Tracey was the one who Hermione knew least. Hermione had talked to Lavender once before, but she’d never really seen Tracey except at wand- point during a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from her sofa to volunteer. “We’ll show him! We’ll show them all!” “Okay,” said Susan, “that was definitely evil—” “No,” said Lavender, “that’s a Chaos Legion motto, actually. Only she didn’t do the insane laughter.” “That’s right,” Tracey said, her voice low and grim. “This time I’m not laughing.” The girl went on stalking through the corridor, like she had dramatic music accompanying her that only she could hear. (Hermione was starting to worry about what exactly the impression- able youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry Potter.) “But—I mean—” Parvati said. She still had a contemplative look on her face. “I mean, you can see why the Headmaster would think we were just silly girls, right? What does protesting outside the Headmaster’s of- fice have to do with becoming heroines?” “Huh,” Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. “That’s true. We should do something heroic. I mean heroinic.” “Um—” said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione’s own feelings on the subject. “Well,” said Parvati, “has everyone already been through Dumble- dore’s third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in Gryffindor’s been through it by now—” “Hold on!” Hermione said desperately. “I don’t want you doing any- thing dangerous!” There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was real- izing, much too late, why Dumbledore hadn’t wanted anyone else to be a hero. “I don’t think you can become a heroine if you never do anything dan- gerous,” Lavender observed reasonably. “Besides,” said Padma, a considering look on her face. “Everyone knows that nothing really bad ever happens in Hogwarts, right? To stu- dents, I mean, not to the Defence Professors. We’ve got all these ancient wards and so on.” “Um—” Hannah said again. “Yeah,” said Parvati, “the worst that can happen is that we’ll lose a few dozen House points or something, and there’s two of us from each House so that’ll all come out even.” “Why, that’s brilliant, Hermione!” said Daphne in a tone of great amazement. “The way you set it up means we can get away with anything! And I didn’t even notice your cunning plan until now!” “Um—” said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan. “Right!” said Parvati. “So now it’s time for us to become real heroines. We’ll come for the darkness—” “And make it face us—” said Lavender. “And teach it to be afraid,” Tracey Davis said grimly. CHAPTER SE V ENT Y-ONE SE LF ACTUALIZATION, PART V I “Well,” Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could, “at least now I don’t feel like the only sane person in Hogwarts any more.” “Because now you’ve got the rest of us as friends?” whispered Lavender Brown, who was tiptoeing along at her left side. “I don’t think that’s what she means,” General Granger murmured from Lavender’s own left. They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of Hogwarts, all eight of them keeping both ears peeled for the slightest sound of Trou- ble, just like it was a battle and they were looking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this case they were looking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the span between the end of breakfast time and when Lavender and Parvati had to get to their Herbology class. Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down three older bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able to outfight twenty- four older bullies because of Multiplication. Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General Gran- ger hadn’t found this convincing. Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument, and then observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up first-year girls probably wouldn’t be good for your reputation as a bully. Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant they were the only ones who could do something about Hogwarts’s bully prob- lem, which made it really truly heroinic. Plus the whole reason their parents had moved to Britain was so that the two of them could attend the world’s only magical school with a 0% fatality rate, and what was the point if they didn’t take advantage and try a few things? To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn’t under- stand the point of a perfect safety record at all— Lavender had said that if they were really all friends together and not Hermione’s followers like Professor Quirrell thought, then they should vote on things like this. Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote after Her- mione and Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had considered it carefully after her first flush of enthusiasm wore off. She was a Slythe- rin, after all, and that meant it was her responsibility to keep a watchful eye on their own interests while they were all running around trying to help people—her job to figure out how risky it really was, and whether it would be worth it for them, just like Mother would have done in her place. Always looking out for yourself and your friends like that, was what real Slytherining was all about… Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a small trem- bling voice said “Yes.” And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione had to stay with the other five, they couldn’t possibly let the others go off on their own. Because no Gryffindor would ever live down hurting the last surviving child of the Bones family, and no Slytherin would dare assault a daughter of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. (Daphne hoped so, anyway.) And General Granger who’d started the whole thing…you didn’t even have to ask. The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another, their tense hands never straying far from their wands, as stone and wood and Everburning Torches came into vision and then moved past. At one point they heard footsteps and drew in their breath, hands almost dropping to their wands, but it was just a lone older Ravenclaw who looked at them curiously before sniffing and dropping his head back to his book as he walked on. The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded fres- cos, and came to a dead end leading into a boys’ bathroom, and turned around, and wandered back through the solemn oaken panels carved with gilded frescos, and then turned through dusty old brick corridors grouted with worn cement, which sort of led them in a circle actually, so they con- sulted a portrait and then went down a different dusty old brick corridor instead, that took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should’ve put them on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it’d been anywhere but Hogwarts, and then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and skylights that let shafts of sunlight pour down even though they were nowhere near the roof, and after they’d followed that passageway around a few corners it took them to another boys’ bathroom, clearly marked with a plaque show- ing the silhouette of a robed figure whizzing into a toilet. The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a cer- tain amount of weariness. “I’m bored,” said Lavender. Padma made a show of taking a pocket watch out of her robes and looking at it. “Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds,” she said. “A new record for the longest attention span in Gryffindor.” “I don’t think this is going to work either,” said Susan. “And I’m a Huf- flepuff.” “Y’know,” Lavender said thoughtfully, “I wonder if maybe what really makes someone a hero, is that when they try something like this, some- thing interesting actually happens.” “I bet you’re right,” said Tracey. “I bet if we had Harry Potter with us, we’d run into three bullies and a hidden room full of treasure in the first five minutes. I bet that all General Chaos has to do is go to the bathroom and he, like, finds Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets or something—” Daphne couldn’t quite let that one go past. “You think Lord Slytherin would’ve put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a bathroom—” “What I’m saying,” said Susan, as Tracey was opening her mouth to reply, “is that we’ve got no way of actually finding any bullies. I mean, all they’ve got to do is find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we’ve got to run across them at exactly the right time, d’you see? Which is a very good prob- lem because if we did find them we’d all get squished like bugs. Can’t we just do the forbidden third-floor corridor like we’re supposed to?” Lavender snorted scornfully. “You don’t become a real heroine just by doing the forbidden things the Headmaster tells you not to do!” (Daphne’s mind tried to wrap around this statement as she silently thanked the Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near Gryffindor.) “Come to think…” Parvati said slowly, “I mean, what’re the odds that Harry Potter would run across those five bullies on his first morning of school? He must’ve had some way of finding them.” Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her see Hermione, so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl’s expression change—and then she realized that the Sunshine General had also found some bullies just recently— “Oh!” said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. “Of course! He got told by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!” “What?” said Daphne at the same time as several other people. “That’s who the ghost was that scared me, I’m pretty sure,” Padma explained. “I mean I only figured it out afterwards, but…yeah. Salazar Slytherin’s ghost doesn’t like it when Slytherins bully people, he thinks it shames his name, and the ghost is still keyed into the Hogwarts wards so he knows everything that happens, I bet.” Daphne’s mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah had put a hand to her forehead and was leaning against the stone walls, while Tracey’s eyes were blazing like little brown stars. Salazar Slytherin’s ghost? Had leagued himself with Harry Potter? And had sent Hermione Granger to stop Derrick’s crew? She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco Mal- foy was told about this. Although considering how fast rumours spread through Hogwarts, now that Padma had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told him thirty minutes ago… In fact…now that Daphne thought about it… “So,” said Parvati. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to find Salazar Slytherin’s ghost? Wow, I guess if I’m saying stuff like that out loud, I might actually be turning into a heroine—” “Yes!” said Lavender. “We’ve got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to find Salazar Slytherin’s ghost!” “We’ve got to ask…the Boy-Who-Lived…where to find Salazar Slythe- rin’s ghost…” repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she was forcing herself to say it. “And if that doesn’t work,” shouted Tracey, “we’ll stun Harry Potter, tie him up and bring him with us!” 1103 CH APTER 71 1104 SELF ACTUALIZATION V I As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year Ravenclaws began shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already wincing to herself. They’d made it to class just barely before the opening gong, they’d had to run right over to their desks and sit down, so there hadn’t been time for the awful thing to happen yet; but that just meant that Hermione got to look forward to the coming disaster for the whole class. Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and ev- eryone rose from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her; and for her own part Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin pouch and very quickly walked over to the door and threw it open and headed into the corridors, and of course Harry followed her with a surprised look because they had a library session scheduled— “Hermione?” Harry said as he closed the door behind him. “What’s wrong?” The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it, al- most hitting Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil stepped out of the classroom with a dreadful look of determination upon her face. “Excuse me, Mr Potter,” came the awful words, the young girl’s high voice resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of doom, “can I ask you for help with something?” Harry’s eyebrows drew up, and he said, “You can ask, of course.” “Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin’s ghost? We want him to tell us where to find bullies, like he tells you.” There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the classroom. The door opened again, and Su Li peered out with an inquiring look— “Well, we’ve got to get to the library,” Harry said quite casually, his face looking relaxed, “would you mind following us?” and began to walk off in the direction that led to the library on odd-numbered days of the month, and Su made like she was going to follow but Harry’s face turned toward her for a moment. It wasn’t until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his wand, said in a low precise voice “Quietus” and then turned to Padma and said, “An interesting guess, Miss Patil.” Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, “I should’ve figured it out earlier, really. There was that hiss in the ghost’s voice, I should’ve thought Parselmouth right away, even before he started talking about Godric Gryf- findor.” Harry’s face didn’t change. “May I ask, Miss Patil, whether you’ve shared this thought with—” “She said it in front of everyone in sphew,” Hermione said. Harry’s eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly calculat- ing something, and then he said, “Hermione, what’s the chance that—” “She said it in front of Lavender and Tracey.” “Um,” said Padma. “Should I not’ve done that?” 1107 CH APTER 71 1108 SELF ACTUALIZATION V I After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again and said, “Are you alright, Mr Malfoy?” Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off into nowhere, like he was trying to stare through the wall of his bedroom, through the Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin dungeons, through Earth’s crust and atmosphere and the interstellar dust of the Milky Way, into the utterly empty and lightless void between galaxies which no wizard and no scientist had ever seen. “Mr Malfoy?” Gregory said, starting to sound a little worried. “I can’t believe I believed every word of that,” said Draco. 1109 CH APTER 71 1110 SELF ACTUALIZATION V I Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working diligently on yet another two-foot essay (she was taking everything except Divina- tion and Muggle Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed to consist entirely of homework) when her Head of House strode up to the table she was working at and barked “You will come with me, Miss Felthorne!” and walked away even as she frantically began putting away her parchment and book and quill. When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just out- side the room and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that seemed far too intense; and before she could ask what this was about he spun without a word and stalked off through the hallways, so that she had to scramble to keep up. Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another, below what she’d thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin dungeons. And the corridors began to look older in their appearance, the architecture reverting back in time by centuries into roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar. She began to wonder if Professor Snape was taking her to the real dungeons that she’d heard rumours of, the true dun- geons of Hogwarts that had been sealed off to all but faculty; and if maybe Professor Snape did terrible things down there to innocent helpless young girls but that was probably just wishful thinking on her part. They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a room that was no room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a single door, pierced by many dark openings and lit by a single torch of ancient style that blazed alight as they entered. Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charm after Charm, she lost track of how many; and when the Potions Master was done he turned back toward her, locked his intense eyes on hers, and said in a level voice unlike his usual drawl, “You will say nothing to anyone of this matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing now or ever. If that is acceptable to you, nod. If not, we will turn and go.” She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her heart (well, not exactly her heart). “The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne,” said Professor Snape’s toneless voice, “and your extremely generous pay of fifty Galleons is merely to compensate you for being Memory-Charmed afterwards.” She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but they had other daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was certainly a lot of money for her. Then her ears caught up with the words Memory-Charmed and for a moment she felt outraged, there was no point if she couldn’t keep the memories, what sort of girl did Professor Snape think she was? “You surely know,” said Severus Snape, “of Miss Hermione Granger, the Sunshine General?” “What?” said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and disgust. “She’s in her first year! Ew!” CHAPTER SE V ENT Y-TWO SE LF ACTUALIZATION, PART V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it was amid the peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall that Hermione left for the Ravenclaw Tower along- side her study partner Harry Potter, who lately seemed to have a ridiculous amount of time for studying. She hadn’t the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his actual homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house elves while he slept. Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them as they passed through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which were more like siege gates of a castle than anything students ought to go through on the way back from supper. They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant babble of student conversation had faded into silence; and then the two of them went on a little further through the stone corridors before Hermione fi- nally spoke. “Why’d you do that, Harry?” “Do what?” said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if his mind were quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important things. “I mean, why didn’t you just tell them no?” “Well,” Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, “I can’t just go around saying ‘no’ every time someone asks me about something I haven’t done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, ‘Harry, did you pull the prank with the invisible paint?’ and I say ‘No’ and then they say ‘Harry, do you know who messed with the Gryffindor Seeker’s broomstick?’ and I say ‘I refuse to answer that question.’ It’s sort of a giveaway.” “And that’s why,” Hermione said carefully, “you told everyone…” She concentrated, remembering the exact words. “That if hypothetically there was a conspiracy, you could not confirm or deny that the true master of the conspiracy was Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, and in fact you wouldn’t even be able to admit the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you questions about it.” “Yep,” said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. “That’ll teach them to take hypothetical scenarios too seriously.” “And you told me not to answer anything—” “They might not believe you, if you deny it,” said Harry. “So it’s better to say nothing, unless you want them to think you’re a liar.” “But—” Hermione said helplessly. “But—but now people think I’m do- ing things for Salazar Slytherin!” The way the Gryffindors had been looking at her—the way the Slytherins had been looking at her— “It goes along with being a hero,” Harry said. “Have you seen what the Quibbler says about me?” For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a newspa- per article about her, and instead of the story being about her winning a nationwide spelling bee or any of the other ways she’d imagined getting into the papers, the headline said “HERMIONE GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT”. It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine busi- ness. Harry’s voice turned a bit more formal. “Speaking of which, Miss Gran- ger, how goes your latest quest?” “Well,” said Hermione, “unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin really does show up and tell us where to find bullies, I don’t think we’re going to have much luck.” Not that she was sorry about that. She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a peculiarly in- tense look. “You know, Hermione,” the boy said quietly, as though to make sure that nobody else in the world heard, “I think you’re right. I think some people get a lot more help than others in becoming heroes. And I don’t think that’s fair, either.” And Harry grabbed at her witch’s robes where they lay over her arm, and hustled her into a side-hall of the corridor they were walking through, her mouth gaping open in surprise even as Harry’s wand came into his hand, they rounded a curve of the side-hall and it was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and Harry into each other, even as Harry pointed to the way they’d come and softly said “Quietus”, then a moment later, in the other direction, “Quietus” again. The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side, but even upward toward the ceiling and down toward the floor. And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, “Invisibility cloak.” “Gleep?” said Hermione. Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric from the mokeskin device. “Don’t worry,” the boy said with a small grin, “they’re so rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule against them…” And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said, his voice strangely formal, “I do not give you, but loan you, my cloak, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well.” She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that swallowed all the light that fell on it except what glinted from small strange reflec- tions, fabric so perfectly black it should’ve shown dust or lint or something but it didn’t, the longer you looked the more you felt like what you were seeing wasn’t really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a black cloak. “Take it, Hermione.” Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp the fabric; and then just as her brain woke up and she started to pull her hand back, Harry let go of the cloak and it started to fall and she grabbed at it without thinking. And the instant her fingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible jolt run through her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of her mind. “That’s one of my quest items, Hermione,” Harry said softly. “It be- longed to my father, and it’s not something I can replace, if it’s lost. Don’t loan it to anyone else, don’t show it to anyone, don’t tell anyone it exists… but if you want to borrow it for a while, just come to me and ask.” Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black folds and stared back up at Harry. “I can’t—” “You certainly can,” Harry said. “Because there’s nothing even the tini- est bit fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box next to my bed one morning, and you…not.” Harry paused thoughtfully. “Unless you did get your own invisibility cloak, in which case never mind.” Then the implications of invisibility cloak finally dawned on her, and she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though they were close enough to- gether that she couldn’t quite straighten her arm properly, and her voice rose with considerable indignation as she said, “So that’s how you disap- peared from the Potions cupboard! And the time when—” and then she trailed off, because even with an invisibility cloak she still couldn’t see how Harry had… Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful nonchalance, and said, “Well, you knew there had to be some trick to it, right? And now the heroine will mysteriously know where and when to find bullies—just like she listened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age could possibly have turned herself invisible to spy on them.” There was a pause and a silence. “Harry—” she said. “I’m—I’m not sure any more that fighting bullies is such a good idea.” Harry’s eyes stayed steady on hers. “Because the other girls might get hurt?” She nodded, just nodded. “That’s their choice, Hermione, just like it’s yours. I decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone does in books, try to keep you safe and protected and helpless, and have you get really angry at me, and push me away while you go off on your own and get into even more trouble, and then heroically pull through it successfully, after which I’d finally have my epiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that part of my life story goes, so I’m just skipping over it. If I can predict what I’m going to think later, I might as well go ahead and think it now. Anyway, my point is, you shouldn’t smother your friends to keep them safe, either. Just tell them up front it’s predictably going to go horribly wrong, and if they still want to be heroines after that, fine.” It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was ever going to get used to the way Harry thought. “Harry, I really,” her voice stuck for a second, “really, really don’t want them getting hurt! Especially because of something I started!” “Hermione,” Harry said seriously, “I’m pretty sure you did the right thing. I don’t see what could realistically happen to them that would be worse for them, in the long run, than not trying.” “What if they get badly hurt?” Hermione said. Her voice felt blocked in her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how Harry had just stared straight into the eyes of a bully as the bully bent his finger back, before Professor Sprout had arrived to save him; and there was another thought that came after that, about Hannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that she carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morn- ing, but that wasn’t allowed to be imagined. “And then—they’ll never do anything courageous, ever again—” “I don’t think it works like that,” Harry said steadily. “Even if it all goes mind-bogglingly wrong, I don’t think it works like that inside a hu- man mind. The important thing is believing about yourself that you’re someone who can break your boundaries. Trying and getting hurt can’t possibly be worse for you than being…stuck.” “What if you’re wrong, Harry?” Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and said, “What if I’m right?” Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand. From the inside the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against her palm, as if it was trying to give her hand a reassuring hug. Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to Harry. Harry didn’t move to take it. “I—” said Hermione. “I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but I’m still thinking about it, so you can take it back for now. And…Harry, I don’t think it’s right to spy on people—” “Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?” Harry said. “I’ve never been bullied, but I’ve been through a realistic simulation, and it didn’t feel very pleasant. Have you ever been bullied, Hermione?” “No,” she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry’s invis- ibility cloak to him. Finally Harry took back his cloak—she felt a small twitch of loss as the inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind—and started to stuff the black material back into his pouch. As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her, to break the Quieting Barrier— “And, um,” Hermione said. “That’s not the Cloak of Invisibility, is it? The one we read about in the library on page eighteen of Paula Vieira’s translation of Gottschalk’s An Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices?” Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in exactly the same tone of voice he’d used earlier with the other students at dinner, “I cannot confirm or deny that I possess magical artifacts of incredible power.” 1118 SELF ACTUALIZATION V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach was filled with flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as she ap- proached the Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn’t decided what to do. There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be where to sit down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask Padma to tell Daphne and Tracey. Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma. There were words waiting in her throat, Padma, I got a mysterious message— And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the words from coming out. She’d be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne in dan- ger. Taking them and leading them by the hand straight into trouble. That was Wrong. Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without telling her friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also Wrong. Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just like all those wizards and witches she’d read about in stories. Only in stories people always got a right choice and a wrong choice, not two wrong ones, which seemed a bit unfair. But she had the sense, somehow—maybe it came from the way Harry always talked about how the history books would see them—that she was faced with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end up going one way or another, depending on what she chose right now, this morning. Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side, just gazing at the plate and silverware like they might have answers hidden inside, thinking as hard as she ever had, and a few seconds later she heard Padma’s voice whispering almost in her ear, “Daphne says she knows where a bully’s going to be at ten-thirty today.” 112 0 SELF ACTUALIZATION V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y 1121 CH APTER 72 At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If anyone had been present to hear—though the corridor was apparently empty— they would have heard his shoes clicking solidly through the main cor- ridor, entering the passageway, walking toward where the passageway turned its first corner, turning that corner, and then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the passageway now terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been before. Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to watch the main passage from just around the corner. It was the castle Hogwarts, after all. Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they’d assembled into the outward appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not speaking, not moving, hardly even breathing, but watching through the eyeholes they’d left themselves. As Susan’s gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening of her chest all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his seventh-year if not older, and his robes were trimmed in green instead of the red they’d been hoping for, and he had muscles, and after staring for a bit longer, Susan realized his stance had the balance that meant that he duelled. Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the cor- ridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been let out of Potions class. The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the bully didn’t do anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of relief— Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached. The bully still didn’t do anything, as the footsteps went past. That happened a few more times. And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one last set of footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully’s voice saying, clear and cold and quiet, “Protego”. Someone did gasp then, though fortunately very very quietly. If they couldn’t get in even a single shot— The bullies were learning already, Susan realized, she hadn’t expected sphew to be able to do this very often before the bullies caught on—but— Hermione had already defeated three bullies—and the school had been buzzing with speculation about Salazar Slytherin’s ghost, yesterday— He’s expecting us! Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only there was no way to convey a message to— “Silencio,” said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice with his wand pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his Shielding Charm shimmering around him. “Accio victim.” When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was dan- gling upside-down as if an invisible hand were holding him high by one leg, his red-trimmed robes beginning to slide down his thighs to reveal the trousers beneath. His mouth was opening and closing helplessly, no sound coming out. “I suppose you’re wondering what’s going on,” the seventh-year Sly- therin said in a quiet, cold voice. “Don’t worry. It’s so simple even a Gryf- findor could understand.” With that, the Slytherin’s left hand formed a fist and drove hard into the Gryffindor’s belly. The fourth-year boy’s body jerked around franti- cally, but still no words left his mouth. “You’re my victim,” said the older Slytherin. “I’m a bully. I’m going to beat you up. And we’ll see if anyone stops me.” It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap. And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and high- pitched voice of a young girl, crying, “Stop, evildoer! Finite Incantatem!” Lavender, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl had volun- teered to be a distraction, while the rest of them executed a flank attack from where the bully wouldn’t expect it, that had been the plan, only now— “In the name of Hogwarts,” cried Lavender’s voice, though they couldn’t see her, “and in the name of heroines everywhere, I command you to let go of that eek!” “Expelliarmus,” said the bully. “Stupefy. Accio stupid heroine.” When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot and un- conscious, Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright crimson-and- gold skirt and blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts robes. The bully was also giving the girl’s upside-down body an odd look, and then he pointed his wand at her and said “Finite Incantatem,” but the clothes stayed the same. Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of Lavender instead of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his fist— “Lagann!” yelled five voices, and five green spirals blasted from five wands aimed through five holes in the false wall, and an instant later Her- mione’s voice shouted “Stupefy!” Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and Hermi- one’s red bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year boy, who jerked and then was still. And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the first- year girls screamed and charged. 1124 SELF ACTUALIZATION V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with ex- haustion, she didn’t have enough magic left for even one Innervate, now. The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying across the ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and Parvati in a heap against one wall, Susan standing in petrified rigor as her eyes tracked it all helplessly, even the Gryffindor boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and he’d fought, but it hadn’t been enough). It had been a very short battle. The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a wavering ripple in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads of sweat on his forehead. The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and stalked toward her like a man-shaped living Lethifold. Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in her choking throat, sprinted past the fallen panelling of the fake brick wall, ran down the passageway with all the speed she could muster, weaving as much as she could— Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the bully’s voice from behind her said “Cluthe!” and she got awful cramps all through her legs, she fell down and slid and hit her head against the wall, only she didn’t even notice the pain of the smack as she started to scream with the twisting muscles— The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she turned her head; approaching her slowly, still wearing that dreadful smile. And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up around themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway, and screamed, “Go away!” “I think not,” said the bully, his voice deep and scary like that of a grown man, sounding very close at hand now. The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed her Most Ancient Blade directly into his groin. There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor— 1126 SELF ACTUALIZATION V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y 1127 CH APTER 72 The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as the seven of them walked into lunch. Then the applause started. It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone applauding at once. A lot of it came from the Gryffindor table, less from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and none from Slytherin. Daphne felt her face tightening. She’d hoped—well, maybe after they found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin to rescue, her fellow Sly- therins would realize— She looked at the Hufflepuff table. Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above his head, although he wasn’t smiling. Maybe he’d heard about Hannah, or maybe he was wondering why Hannah wasn’t there. Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the Head Ta- ble. Professor Sprout’s face was lined with concern. She and Professor McGonagall were leaning their heads toward Headmaster Dumbledore, who had a solemn look, and all their lips were moving quickly. Profes- sor Flitwick looked more resigned than anything else, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his soup using a spoon gripped in a fist. Professor Snape was looking directly at— Her? Or—at Hermione Granger, standing next to her? A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master’s face, and he raised his hands, brought them together once in a motion that was too slow to be a real clap; and then the Potions Master turned back to his plate, ignoring the conversations around him. Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily turned to walk toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and Parvati peeled off from their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables on the other side of the Great Hall. It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table where the Slytherin Quidditch team sat. That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled hard like she was being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the gap be- tween where Marcus Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a sad little splutching sound as Hermione’s face ended up in Flint’s plate of steak and mashed potatoes. Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was just Daphne herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a bellow of in- dignation and his hand yanked Hermione back and threw her into the Ravenclaw table, and she bounced off a student’s back and collapsed onto the ground— The quiet spread out in ripples. Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn’t get all the way to her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was shaking, and that her face was still covered with mashed potatoes with scattered pieces of steak. For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in the whole Great Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could, what hap- pened next. Then Flint’s powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain that bel- lowed commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous rumble, “You ruined my food, girl.” Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione’s head—Daphne could see it trembling—turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch Captain. “Apologize to me,” said Flint. Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw table, and then stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he’d just thought of something— Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table. All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming into their hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor table and at the Hufflepuff table and without thinking Daphne turned to look at the Head Table and she saw that the Headmaster was still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore was just watching and he had one hand out as though to restrain Professor McGonagall—in just one second someone would shout a spell and then it would be too late, why wasn’t the Headmaster doing anything— And a voice said, “My apologies.” Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute shock. “Scourgify,” said that smooth voice, and the mashed potatoes vanished from Hermione’s face, revealing the Ravenclaw’s surprised expression as Draco Malfoy approached her, sheathed his wand again, and then knelt to one knee beside her and offered her a hand. “Sorry about that, Miss Granger,” said Draco Malfoy’s polite voice. “I guess someone thought they were being funny.” Hermione took Draco’s hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what was about to happen— But Draco Malfoy didn’t raise Hermione halfway up and then drop her. He just pulled her to her feet. “Thanks,” said Hermione. “You’re welcome,” Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking to ei- ther side to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were staring at him in total shock. “Just remember, being cunning and ambitious doesn’t mean you have to be like that.” And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin bench and sat down like he hadn’t—he hadn’t just—he’d just— Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench and sat down. A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down. “Daphne?” said Tracey. “Are you all right?” 1131 CH APTER 72 “Do you know what the boss’s up to?” Vincent muttered in an under- tone. Gregory Goyle didn’t reply. In his mind he could hear very clearly his master’s voice, saying, I can’t believe I believed every word of that, the day the rumour had started about Salazar Slytherin showing Potter and Granger where to find bullies. “Mr Goyle?” whispered Vincent. Gregory Goyle’s lips shaped the words, Oh no, but no sound came out. 1132 SELF ACTUALIZATION V II: PLAUSIBLE DE NIABILIT Y Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and Ash- winder sauce (it wasn’t made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just tasted like fire), trying not to laugh and trying not to cry. He’d heard about plausible deniability, but hadn’t realized how much it mattered until he found that Malfoys didn’t have any. “You want to know my plot?” said Draco. “Here’s my plot. I’m not going to do anything and then the next time people think I’m plotting something, they won’t be sure.” “Huh…” said the fifth-year boy. “I don’t think I believe you, that doesn’t sound cunning enough to be really it—” “That’s what he wants you to think,” said the fifth-year girl. “Well, if I did snap my fingers under the table, I wouldn’t just tell you that—” “What do you mean, set you up?” said Millicent. The two of them were sitting cross-legged on Daphne’s bed, having come there straight from the Great Hall after lunch. “With my Seer’s eyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw you winning.” Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather nar- rowed at the moment. “That boy was expecting us.” “Well, yeah!” said Millicent. “Everyone knows you’re hunting bullies!” “Hannah got hit by a really painful hex,” Daphne said. “She had to visit a healer, Millicent! If we’re friends you should’ve warned me!” “Look, Daphne, I told you—” The Slytherin girl paused, as if trying to remember something, and then said, “I mean, I told you, what I See has to come to pass. If I try to change it, if anyone tries to change it, really terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it’ll come to pass anyway. If I See you getting beaten up, I can’t tell you that, because then you’d try to not go, and then—” Millicent stopped. “And then?” Daphne said skeptically. “I mean, what happens if we just don’t go?” “I don’t know!” said Millicent. “But it probably makes being eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party!” “Look, even I know that’s not how prophecies work,” Daphne said, then paused. “At least prophecies don’t work like that in plays…” Admit- tedly, there were all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid a prophecy made it happen, or where, on the other hand, trying to go along with a prophecy was the only reason why it happened. But you could make prophecies happen your own way if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough could take your place; or with enough effort it was possible to break a prophecy outright…Then again, in plays the Seers never remembered what they Saw, either… Millicent must have seen Daphne’s hesitation, because the other girl started looking a little more confident. “Well,” Millicent said sharply, “this isn’t a play! Look, I’ll tell you if I See it being a hard battle or an easy one. But that’s all I can do, you understand? And if I say ‘hard’ you can’t not show up! Or—or—” Millicent’s eyes rolled back in her head, and she intoned hollowly, “Those who try to cheat their destinies will come to sad and gloomy ends—” 1135 CH APTER 72 “A mysterious parchment under your pillow?” said Harry Potter, look- ing up from where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where they were studying. Then the boy’s green eyes narrowed. “It wasn’t from Santa Claus, was it?” Pause. “Okay,” said Hermione. “I’m not going to ask, and you’re not going to tell me, and we’re both going to pretend you never said that and I don’t know anything about it—” Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently consid- ered a promising upstart on the youth duelling circuit, stood ramrod straight in Professor Snape’s office, with his teeth clenched tight and sweat trickling down his spine. “I distinctly recall,” said the Head of his House in a sardonic drawl, “that I warned you, and a number of others this very morning, that there were certain first-year girls who might prove annoying, if a fighter were incautious and allowed himself to be taken by surprise.” Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him. “I—” said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew how ridiculous it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. “Sir, they shouldn’t have been able to—” One first-year-girl shouldn’t have been able to break his Protego, no matter what sort of ancient Charm she used—Greengrass must have had help— But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn’t believe that. “Oh, I quite agree,” murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with men- ace. “They shouldn’t have. I begin to wonder if Mr Malfoy, whatever his plotting, has a point, Astorga. It cannot be good for the repute of Slythe- rin’s House if our fighters, rather than demonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!” Snape’s voice had risen. “It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House, Astorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!” Jaime Astorga’s fists clenched at his side, but he couldn’t think of a thing to say. It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the pres- ence of his Head of House. And afterwards, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw Severus Snape’s smile. 1137 CH APTER 72 1138 1139 CH APTER 73 1140 SELF ACTUALIZATION V III: THE SACRE D AND THE MUNDANE “Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, “I’m worried about the hatred Slythe- rin House seems to be developing for Hermione Granger.” They were sitting in the Defence Professor’s office, Harry sitting far back from the teacher’s desk (and the sense of pending disaster was still noticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still framing Professor Quirrell’s balding head. The cup balanced on Harry’s thigh was filled with Professor Quirrell’s obscure, probably-expensive Chinese tea, and it said something about the way Harry had been thinking lately that he’d needed to make a conscious decision to drink it. “And this concerns me for what reason?” said Professor Quirrell, sip- ping his tea. “Yes, well,” said Harry, “I’m just going to ignore that—oh, stop that, Professor Quirrell, you’ve been plotting to restore Slytherin House’s repu- tation since at least the first Friday of this year.” There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of those thin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. “I think Slythe- rin’s House will do well enough in the end, Mr Potter, regardless of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present outlook is not favourable for your little friend. The bullies of two Houses, many of them with pow- erful and well-connected families, see Miss Granger as a threat to their reputation and a shame to their pride. As powerful a motive as that is to hurt her, it pales compared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors, who see an outsider gaining the laurels of heroism which they have dreamed of since childhood.” Now the smile on Professor Quirrell’s lips was def- inite, though slight. “And then there are those of Slytherin House who hear that Salazar Slytherin’s ghost has abandoned them to favour a mud- blood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr Potter, of how such as they would react? Those who do not believe it would cheerfully kill Miss Gran- ger for the insult. And as for those Slytherins who wonder deep down, in some quiet place within themselves, if it might perhaps be true…their in- ner panic is something scarcely to be contemplated.” Professor Quirrell sipped his tea equably. “When you are more experienced, Mr Potter, you will see such consequences in advance of your plotting. As it stands, you are being ill-served by your wilful ignorance of all human nature you deem unpleasant.” Harry sipped his own tea. “Ah…” said Harry. “Professor Quirrell…help?” “I already offered Miss Granger my help,” said Professor Quirrell, “as soon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told me, in po- lite terms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she tell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly gain or lose in this matter, I hardly intend to press the point.” The Defence Professor shrugged, his teacup held steady in the exactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquid did not even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair. “Do not worry too much, Mr Potter. Emotions run high around Miss Granger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you are older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which any ordinary person does is nothing.” 1142 SELF ACTUALIZATION V III: THE SACRE D AND THE MUNDANE “What are you doing here?” yelled General Granger, though it was sort of a yell and a whisper at the same time. Susan’s round face didn’t change, like the Hufflepuff girl had suddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne’s own Mother used. “Am I here, really?” Susan said calmly. “You said you wouldn’t come!” “Did I say that?” said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in one hand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they were waiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in perfect order against the yellow trim of her witch’s robes. “I wonder why. Maybe I didn’t want Hannah to get any strange ideas. Hufflepuff loyalty, you know.” “If you don’t leave,” said the Sunshine General, “I’ll call a mission abort, and we’ll all go back to our study halls, Miss Bones!” “Hey!” said Lavender. “We didn’t vote on—” “That’s fine by me,” said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze on the other end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled hallway where they’d been told to expect the bully. “I’ll just stay here myself, then.” “Why—” said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. If I try to change it, if anyone tries to change it, really terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it’ll come to pass anyway… “Why are you doing this?” “It’s not like me,” said Susan. “I know. But—” Susan shrugged. “People don’t always behave like themselves, you know.” They pleaded. They begged. Susan didn’t even say anything any more, she just kept watching, wait- ing. Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she’d caused this, if trying to change Fate was making this happen worse— “Daphne,” said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher than usual, “go get a teacher. Run.” Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other direction of the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she turned back to where all the other girls except Susan were watching her go, and Daphne, feeling like she was about to throw up, said, “I can’t…” “What?” said Hermione. “I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it,” said Daphne. That was how it worked in plays, sometimes. Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, “Padma.” The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without arguing. Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn’t as good a runner as her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be the only reason why help would come too late… “Bullies are here,” Susan said laconically. “Huh, they’ve got a hostage.” They all whirled, and looked, and saw— Three older bullies, Daphne’s eyes recognized Reese Belka who was a top lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies, and Randolph Lee who was number two in the Hogwarts duelling club, and worst of all, Robert Jugson III, in his sixth year, whose father was almost certainly a Death Eater. All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes that glowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other colour and showed oc- casional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of them thought they were fighting serious duellists and had expended energy accordingly. And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was Han- nah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was moving, though they couldn’t hear anything through the Quietus they’d put up ear- lier. Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the glow- ing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as Hannah’s body blew through the Quieting barrier, Susan’s wand was instantly pointing at Hannah and Susan’s voice muttered “Wingardium Leviosa”— “Run!” screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to the ground. But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now blocked with a glowing grey field, a barrier spell that Daphne didn’t recognize. “Do I need to explain what this is about?” Lee said with false jovial- ity. The seventh-year duellist was sporting a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Well, just in case, you little inconveniences, and that includes you Miss Greengrass, you’ve been quite enough trouble and you’ve told quite enough lies. We brought your little friend just to make sure everyone knew we got all of you—though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl is hiding around a corner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, no matter. This is your—” “Enough talk,” said Robert Jugson III, “time for pain,” and raised his wand. “Cluthe!” Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said “Prismatis!” and a small rainbow sphere formed in mid-air almost instantly, the miniature barrier so condensed and bright that it stayed intact even as Jugson’s hex hit it and bounced off toward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat away the dark bolt; and then a moment later the many-coloured blaze was gone. Daphne’s eyes went wide for a moment; she’d never thought of using a Prismatic Sphere like that— “Jugsy, honey?” said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile. “I thought we discussed this. First we beat them, then we play.” “P-please,” said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, “let them go— I, I, I promise I’ll—” “Oh, really,” said Lee in an annoyed tone. “Are you about to offer to turn yourself over if we let the others go? We’ve got all of you, now.” Jugson smiled, then. “It could be funny,” said the sixth-year junior Death Eater, softly and with menace. “How about if you lick my shoes, mudblood, and one of your friends can go? Pick whichever one you like best, leave the others to get hurt.” “Nope,” said the young voice of Susan Bones, “not going to happen,” and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl leapt leftward just as a red stun bolt erupted from Belka’s wand, Daphne could hardly see the movement as Susan seemed to hit the corridor wall and then bounce off it like she was a rubber ball and her legs smashed into Jugson’s face, it didn’t go through the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with the impact and Susan followed him downward and her foot stamped down on the boy’s wand arm, again being repelled by the shield, “Elmekia!” shouted Lee and Parvati shouted “Prismatis!” and the rainbow wall formed but the fiery blue blast passed right through it like it wasn’t even there, the bolt missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind of motion that Daphne couldn’t follow during which Belka had her feet knocked out from under her, but the older witch just rolled back to a stand and then— Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth “Pris—” but it was already too late. Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had her wand raised as though she could counter them and there was a white flash as the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan’s legs convulsed and sent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head hit with a strange cracking sound, and then Susan fell down and lay motionless with her head at an odd-seeming angle, her wand still clutched in one outstretched hand. There was a moment of frozen silence. Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over the pulse point on Susan’s wrist, and then—then slowly, tremblingly, Parvati rose to her feet, her eyes huge— “Vitalis revelio,” said Lee just as Parvati opened her mouth, and Susan’s body was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the seventh-year boy re- ally was grinning. “Probably just a broken collarbone, I’d say. Nice try, though.” “Merlin, they are tricky,” said Jugson. “You had me going for a second there, dearies.” The seventh-year girl wasn’t smiling at all. “Tonare!” screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her head and fo- cusing harder than she ever had in her life. “Ravum Calvaria! Lucis—” She didn’t even see the hex that got her. 1147 CH APTER 73 1148 SELF ACTUALIZATION V III: THE SACRE D AND THE MUNDANE 1149 CH APTER 73 1150 SELF ACTUALIZATION V III: THE SACRE D AND THE MUNDANE 1151 CH APTER 73 “What happened?” Susan blurted to the girl who looked exactly like her, except for the scorched robes damp with sweat. “Ooh, great question!” said the other Susan Bones as she rapidly skinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later the girl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form of Nymphadora Tonks. “Sorry but I couldn’t think of anything myself so you’ve got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that—” 1152 SELF ACTUALIZATION V III: THE SACRE D AND THE MUNDANE 1153 CH APTER 73 1154 1155 CH APTER 74 1156 SELF ACTUALIZATION IX: ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS 1157 CH APTER 74 Somehow, even though they were all equals and she definitely wasn’t in charge, it was always Hermione who ended up speaking first in this sort of situation. The four tables of Hogwarts, the four Houses having breakfast, were glancing over at where they, the eight members of sphew, had gathered off to one side. Professor Flitwick was also staring sternly at all of them from the Head Table. Hermione wasn’t looking there, but she could feel Profes- sor Flitwick’s gaze on the back of her neck. Literally feel it. It was really creepy. “Why’d you tell Tracey you wanted to talk to us, Mr Potter?” said Her- mione, her tone crisp. “Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka from her army last night,” Harry Potter said. “And from all her other after-school Defence activities. Do any of you see the significance of that? Miss Greengrass? Padma?” Harry’s eyes swept over them, as Hermione exchanged a puzzled glance with Padma, and Daphne shook her head. “Well,” Harry said quietly, “I wouldn’t actually expect you to. But what it means is that you’re in danger, and I don’t know how much danger.” The boy squared his shoulders, looking straight into Hermione’s eyes. “I wasn’t going to say this, but…I just wanted to offer to put you under what- ever protection I could give. Make it clear to everyone that anyone who messes with you, is messing with the Boy-Who-Lived.” “Harry!” said Hermione sharply. “You know I don’t want—” “Some of them are my friends too, Hermione.” Harry didn’t take his eyes from hers. “And it’s their decision, not yours. Padma? You told me that I owed you no debt for what I did, and that’s the sort of thing a friend would say.” Hermione broke her gaze from Harry, to look at where Padma was shaking her head. “Lavender?” Harry said. “You fought well in my army, and I’ll fight for you if you wish it.” “Thank you, General!” Lavender said crisply. “I mean Mr Potter. No, though. I’m a heroine and a Gryffindor, and I can fight for myself.” There was a pause. “Parvati?” Harry said. “Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I don’t know any of you so well, but it’s something I would offer anyone who came to ask it of me, I think.” One by one, the other four girls shook their heads. Hermione realized what was coming, then, but she didn’t see a single thing she could do about it. “And my loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?” said Harry Potter. “Really?” gasped Tracey, oblivious to the stabbing glares that Hermi- one and every other girl were directing at her. Tracey’s hands flew artfully to her cheeks, though she didn’t actually manage to blush, not that Her- mione could see; and her brown eyes were, if not shining, at least opened very wide. “You’d do that? For me? I mean—I mean, of course, absolutely, General Chaos—” The Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches hadn’t announced it, it didn’t seem like it would do any good to announce it. But they had all quietly decided (or, in the case of Lavender, been shouted into it by all seven other girls) to take a break from fighting bullies for a while, at least until their Heads of House weren’t looking at them quite so sharply any more, and older students had stopped bumping Hermione into walls. Daphne had told Millicent that they were taking a break. And so it was with some puzzlement, a few days later, that Daphne looked at the parchment delivered to her at lunch, drawn in a hand so shaky it was almost unreadable, saying: 2 this afternoon at the top of the stairs going up from the library really impor- tant everyone has to be there—Millicent Daphne looked around, but she couldn’t see Millicent anywhere in the Great Hall. “A message from your informant?” said Hermione, when Daphne told her. “That’s odd— I didn’t—” “You didn’t what?” said Daphne, after the Ravenclaw girl had stopped in mid-sentence. The Sunshine General shook her head and said, “Listen, Daphne, I think we need to know where these messages come from before we keep following them. Look at what happened last time, how could anyone have known where those three bullies would be, unless they were in on it?” “I can’t say—” Daphne said. “I mean, I can’t say anything, but I know where the messages come from, and I know how anyone can know.” Hermione gave Daphne a look that, for a moment, made the Raven- claw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall. “Uh huh,” said Hermione. “And do you know how Susan suddenly turned into Supergirl?” Daphne shook her head, and said, “No, but I think it might be really im- portant that if we get a message saying we should be somewhere, everyone has to be there.” Daphne hadn’t seen what had happened with Susan, after Daphne had tried to avert the prophecy by keeping Susan away. But she’d been told about it afterwards, and now Daphne was afraid that… She might have possibly… Might possibly have Broken Something… “Uh huh,” said Hermione, who was doing the McGonagall Stare again. 1161 CH APTER 74 “Every single one of you had better be absolutely clear on this,” said Su- san Bones. The Hufflepuff girl, or whatever strange power had possessed her, wasn’t even pretending to act normal any more. The round-faced girl was striding through the halls with a firm, confident gait. “If we get there and it’s just one bully, that’s fine, you can fight them the regular way. My mysterious superpowers won’t activate if there are no innocents in dan- ger. But if five seventh-year bullies jump out of a cupboard, you know what you do? That’s right, you run away and let me fight them. Finding a teacher is optional, the important thing is that you run away as soon as I create an opening. In a fight like that you are liabilities. You are civilian targets I have to worry about protecting. So you will get away as fast as pos- sible and you will not try to do anything heroic or so help me, the hour you get out of your healer’s beds I will personally show up and kick your arses right back in. Are we all clear on that?” “Yes,” squeaked most of the girls, though in Hannah’s case it came out, “Yes, Lady Susan!” “Don’t call me that,” snapped Susan. “And I don’t think I heard you, Miss Brown! I’m warning you, I have friends who write plays and if you do anything dumb, posterity will remember you as Lavender, the Amazing Stupid Hostage.” (Hermione was beginning to worry about just how many other Hog- warts students besides Harry had mysterious dark sides, and whether she was likely to develop one if she kept hanging out with them.) “Alright, Captain Bones,” said Lavender in an unusually respectful tone, as they turned another corner along the shortest way to the library, passing through a rather large corridor studded with six sets of double doors, three sets on either side. “Can I ask if there’s any way for me to become a double witch?” “Sign up for Auror preparation in your sixth year,” said Susan. “It’s the next best thing. Oh, and if a famous Auror offers to oversee your summer internship, just ignore anyone who warns you that he’s a terrible influence or that you’re almost certainly going to die.” Lavender was nodding rapidly. “Got it, got it.” (Padma, who hadn’t actually been there last time, was giving Susan very skeptical looks.) Then Susan suddenly stopped in place and her wand snapped up and she said, “Protego Maximus!” A jolt of adrenaline went through Hermione, she was instantly draw- ing her wand and spinning around— But she couldn’t see anything wrong, through the greater blue haze now surrounding them all. The other girls, who had likewise pulled into formation, were also looking puzzled. “Sorry!” said Susan. “Sorry, girls. Give me a moment to check this place out. Thinking of a certain person has just reminded me that this hall we’re in right now, with all those doors, would be an excellent place for an ambush.” There was a moment of silence. “Now,” said a harsh male voice, blurred into unidentifiability by a buzzing undertone. All six sets of double doors slammed open. White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes without marks of House affiliation and white cloth hiding the faces beneath the hoods. They marched out, and marched out, crowding the great corridor in numbers too high to count easily. Less than fifty robes, probably. Cer- tainly more than thirty. All of them already surrounded by blue haze. Susan said some Extremely Bad Words, so awful that at almost any other time, Hermione would have noticed. “That message!” Daphne cried in sudden horror. “It wasn’t from—” “Millicent Bulstrode?” said the voice and its buzzing undertone. “No, it wasn’t. You see, Miss Greengrass, if the same girl sends off a Slytherin message every day you fight a bully, pretty soon someone else will notice. We’ll have a talk with her after we’re done with you.” “Miss Susan,” said Hannah in a voice just starting to quaver, “can you be super enough to—” Wands rose in many hands. There came a series of blinding flashes of green light, a massive volley of shield breakers, at the end of which there was no more protective blue dome surrounding them, and Susan had fallen to her knees, clutching her head. Barriers of solid blackness had sprung into being at both ends of the corridor. Behind the double doors that Hermione could see into, there were only unused classrooms, very dead ends. “No,” said the male voice with that buzz overlaid, “she can’t. In case you haven’t noticed, you’ve made quite a lot of people very angry with you and we have no intention of losing this time. All right everyone, prepare to fire.” The wands around the perimeter aimed again, low enough that their enemies wouldn’t hit each other if they missed. And then another male voice, with a similar buzz accompanying it, suddenly said “Hominem Revelio!” An instant later there was another massive volley of shield breakers and hexes, fired on reflex at the suddenly revealed figure, shattering the shields which had almost immediately begun to form around it— And then, as that same figure fell to the ground, a stunned silence. “Professor Snape?” said the second voice. “He’s the one who’s been inter- fering?” It was the Potions Master of Hogwarts who now lay unconscious on the stone floor, the dirt-spotted robes stirring for a final moment before they settled in place, his fallen hand outstretched toward where his wand was slowly rolling away. “No,” said the first male voice, now sounding a bit more uncertain. Then it rallied, “No, that can’t possibly be it. He heard us passing the word, of course, and came along to make sure nobody screwed it up again. We’ll wake him up afterwards and apologize and he’ll Memory-Charm the chil- dren so they don’t remember, he’s a Professor so he can do that. Anyway, we should make sure we’re really alone now. Veritas Oculum!” Fully two dozen different Charms must have been spoken, then, but no more invisible people showed up. One of them in particular made Her- mione’s heart sink; she recognized it as the Charm which had been listed alongside the description of the True Cloak of Invisibility, which would not reveal the Cloak, but would tell you whether it or certain other arti- facts were nearby. “Girls?” whispered Susan. She was slowly pushing herself to her feet, though Hermione could see her limbs swaying and quivering. “Girls, I’m sorry for what I said before. If you’ve got anything clever and heroic to try, you might as well try it.” “Oh, yeah,” Tracey Davis said then, her voice trembling. “I almost for- got.” The Slytherin girl raised her voice, and spoke. “Hey, all of you!” yelled Tracey in a high-pitched shaky shout. “Hey, are you planning to hurt me too?” “Yes, actually,” said the buzzing voice of the leader. “We are.” “I’m under Harry Potter’s protection, you know! Anyone who tries to hurt me will learn the true meaning of Chaos! So are you going to let me go?” It should have sounded defiant. It came out sounding terrified. There was a pause. Some of the hoods of the robes turned to face each other, then turned back to face the girls. “Hm…” said the buzzing male voice. “Hm…no.” Tracey Davis put her wand away into her robes. Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand high in the air, and pressed her thumb and forefingers together. “Go ahead,” said that voice. Tracey Davis snapped her fingers. There was a long, awful pause. Nothing happened. “Yes, well,” said the voice— Tracey said, her voice sounding even higher and shakier, “Acathla, mundatus sum.” Her hand, stretching up still further, snapped its fingers a second time. A nameless chill went down Hermione’s spine then, a frisson of fear and disorientation like she’d just felt the floor tilt beneath her, threatening to spill her into some darkness lying beneath. “What’s she—” began a buzzing female voice. Tracey’s face looked pale, twisted with fear, but her lips moved, spilled forth sound in a high chant, “Mabra, brahoring, mabra…” A chill wind seemed to spring up within the confines of the corridor, a dark breath that caressed their faces and touched their hands with ice. “Fire at her on my count!” shouted the leading voice. “One, two, three!” and maybe-forty voices roared spells, creating a huge concentric array of fiery bolts that lit the wide corridor brighter than the Sun— —for the short moment before the bolts struck and vanished upon a dark-red octagon that appeared in the air around the girls, and then dis- appeared a moment later. Hermione saw it, she saw it but she still couldn’t imagine it; she couldn’t imagine a Shielding Charm that powerful, a spell that would withstand an army. And Tracey’s voice went on chanting, her voice sounding louder and more confident, and her face screwed up like she was trying to remember something very exactly. “Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff. Fista, wista, mista-cuff.” Now all those present could feel it, heroines and bullies alike, the sen- sation of some dark will pressing down on them, a tingling in the air as something built and built and built. All the blue hazes around the white robes, all the shielding spells, had died out without any visible hex touch- ing them. There were more flashes of light as more desperate spells were fired, but they fizzled out in mid-air like candle-flames touching water. The black barriers at the two ends of the corridor had dissipated like smoke beneath the growing pressure, but their evaporation revealed the exits sealed, blocked by tiled slats of dark metal that looked stained as though with blood; and as Tracey chanted “Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarc- hand,” a dreadful blue light began to shine out from beneath the metal slats and between them; and the six sets of double doors slammed shut all at once, as panicked white-robed bullies began to pound on them and howl. Then Tracey’s hand slashed to her left, and she cried “Khornath!”, then her hand pointed below her and “Slaaneth!”, above her “Nurgolth!”, and then, to her right, “Tzintchi!” Tracey paused, took a deep breath; and Hermione found her voice and cried, “Stop! Tracey, stop!” But there was a strange wild smile on Tracey’s face. She raised her hand still higher, and snapped her fingers a third time; and when she spoke again, beneath her high girlish voice there was an undertone as though some lower chorus were chanting along with her. “Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black. Buried beneath the flow of time… From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the emptiness, Unknown to death, nor known to life.” “What are you doing?” shrieked Parvati, and the Gryffindor girl stretched out a hand as though to pull down the Slytherin, who was now starting to float upward into the air; and both Daphne and Susan grabbed Parvati’s arm at the same time and Daphne cried out, “Don’t, we don’t know what will happen if the ritual is interrupted!” “Well what happens if it gets COMPLETED?” screamed Hermione, as close as she’d ever come to total brain meltdown. Susan’s face was white as chalk, and she whispered, “I’m sorry, Mad- Eye…” And Tracey spoke on, her body floating higher and higher off the floor, her black hair whipping wildly around her in the chill winds. “You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and guardian of the gate: I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before me!” The corridor was plunged then into utter darkness and silence, so that only Tracey could be seen and heard, like there was nothing left in the universe except her and the light illuminating her from some nameless source. The shining girl raised her hand one final time, and with dreadful grav- ity, pressed her thumb and forefinger together. And within the darkness Hermione looked at Tracey’s face and saw that the Slytherin girl’s eyes were now, to the exact shade, the green of Harry Potter’s. “Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres! Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres! HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!” There was a snap like thunder, and then— 1168 SELF ACTUALIZATION IX: ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS 1169 CH APTER 74 1170 SELF ACTUALIZATION IX: ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS 1171 CH APTER 74 1172 SELF ACTUALIZATION IX: ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS 1173 CH APTER 74 It was with some surprise that Harry stepped out from between the huge grey gargoyles which had made way for him, and saw that Quirinus Quirrell was still slumped against the stone of the corridor wall, a thick thread of spittle drooling from his slack mouth onto his Professorial robes, in just the same position he’d occupied when Harry had first gone up into the Headmaster’s office. Harry waited, but the slumped man didn’t rise up; and after long awk- ward seconds, Harry began to walk down the corridor again. “Mr Potter?” came a soft call, after Harry had turned two corners; a quiet voice carrying unnaturally through the halls. When Harry had returned he found Professor Quirrell still slumped against the wall, but the pale eyes now watched him with keen intelli- gence. I’m sorry to have tired you out— It was something that Harry couldn’t say. He’d noticed the correlation between the effort Professor Quirrell expended and the time he had to spend ‘resting’. But Harry had reasoned that if the effort was too painful or detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell would just say no. Now Harry was wondering if that reasoning had actually been correct, and if not, how to apologize… The Defence Professor spoke in a quiet voice, the rest of the body un- moving. “How went your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr Potter?” “I’m not sure,” Harry said. “Not the way I predicted. He seems to be- lieve the Light should lose a lot more often than I’d consider wise. Plus I’m not sure he understands the difference between trying to fight and trying to win. It explains a lot, actually…” Harry hadn’t read much about the Wiz- arding War, but he’d read enough to know that the good guys probably had acquired a pretty accurate picture of who most of the worst Death Eaters were, and hadn’t just owled them all hand grenades over the course of five minutes. A soft, soft laugh from the pale lips. “Dumbledore does not compre- hend the enjoyment of winning, just as he does not comprehend the en- joyment of the game. Tell me, Mr Potter. Did you suggest this little plan with the deliberate intention of relieving my tedium?” “That was among my many motives,” Harry said, because some in- stinct had warned that he couldn’t just say Yes. “Do you know,” the Defence Professor said in soft reflective tones, “there are those who have tried to soften my darker moods, and those who have indeed participated in brightening my day, but you are the first person ever to succeed in doing it deliberately?” The Defence Professor seemed to straighten up from the wall with a peculiar motion which might have included magic as well as muscle; and the Defence Professor began to walk away without a look back in Harry’s direction. Only a single small gesture of one finger indicated that Harry was to follow. “I particularly enjoyed that chant you composed for Miss Davis,” said Professor Quirrell after they had walked a short distance. “Though you might have been wiser to consult me in advance, before giving it to her to memorize.” One hand bestirred itself to within the Defence Professor’s robes and drew forth a wand, which traced a small gesture in the air, af- ter which all the faraway sounds of the castle Hogwarts fell silent. “Tell me honestly, Mr Potter, have you somehow acquired a familiarity with the theory of Dark rituals? That is not the same as confessing an intent to cast them; many wizards know the principles.” “No…” Harry said slowly. He had decided some time ago against try- ing to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library, for much the same reason he’d decided a year earlier not to look up how to make ex- plosives out of common household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having more sense than people thought he did. “Oh?” said Professor Quirrell. The man was walking more normally now, and the lips curved about in a peculiar smile. “Why, perhaps you possess a natural talent for the field, then.” “Yes, well,” Harry said wearily. “I suppose Dr Seuss also has a natural talent for Dark rituals, because the part about shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff came from a children’s book called Bartholomew and the Oobleck—” “No, not that part,” said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew a little stronger, took on some of its normal lecturing tone. “An ordinary Charm, Mr Potter, can be cast merely by speaking certain words, making precise motions of the wand, expending some of your own strength. Even pow- erful spells may be invoked in this way, if the magic is efficient as well as efficacious. But with the greatest of magics, speech alone does not suffice to give them structure. You must perform specific actions, make signif- icant choices. Nor is the temporary expenditure of your own strength sufficient to set them in motion; a ritual requires permanent sacrifice. The power of such a greater spell, compared to ordinary Charms, can be like day compared to night. But many rituals—indeed, most—happen to demand at least one sacrifice which might inspire squeamishness. And so the entire field of ritual magic, containing all the furthest and most interesting reaches of wizardry, is widely regarded as Dark. With a few exceptions carved out by tradition, of course.” Professor Quirrell’s voice took on a sardonic tinge. “The Unbreakable Vow is too useful to certain wealthy Houses to be outlawed entirely—even though to bind a man’s will through all his days is indeed a dread and terrible act, more fearsome than many lesser rituals that wizards shun. A cynic might conclude that which rituals are prohibited is not so much a matter of morality, as habit. But I digress…” Professor Quirrell made a brief coughing sound, a clear- ing of his throat. “The Unbreakable Vow requires three participants and three sacrifices. The one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be one who could have come to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demand the Vow from them, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The one who makes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do what the Vow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice. And the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small portion of their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever.” “Ah,” Harry said. “I’d wondered why that spell wasn’t used all over the place, every time two people have difficulty trusting each other… although…why don’t wizards on their deathbeds charge money to bind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to leave an inheritance for their children—” “Because they are stupid,” said Professor Quirrell. “There are hun- dreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so much sense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath. But in any case, Mr Potter, the thing about such rituals—whether or not you choose to term them Dark—is that they are shaped to be magically efficacious, not to appear impressive when performed. I suppose there is a certain tendency for the more powerful rituals to require more dreadful sacri- fices. Even so, the most terrible ritual known to me demands only a rope which has hanged a man and a sword which has slain a woman; and that for a ritual which promised to summon Death itself—though what is truly meant by that I do not know and do not care to discover, since it was also said that the counter-spell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dread chant I have encountered does not sound even a hundredth as fear- some as the chant you composed for Miss Davis. Those among the bullies who had a passing familiarity with Dark rituals—and I am certain that there were some—must have been terrified beyond the capacity of words to describe. If there existed a true ritual which appeared that impressive, Mr Potter, it would melt the Earth.” “Um,” said Harry. Professor Quirrell’s lips twisted further. “Ah, but the truly amusing thing was this. You see, Mr Potter, the chant of every ritual names that which is to be sacrificed, and that which is to be gained. The chant which you gave to Miss Davis spoke, first, of a darkness beyond darkness, buried beneath the flow of time, which knows the gate, and is the gate. And the second thing spoken of, Mr Potter, was the manifestation of your own presence. And always, in each element of the ritual, first is named that which is sacrificed, and then is said the use commanded of it.” “I…see,” said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts after Pro- fessor Quirrell, following him toward the Defence Professor’s office. “So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that the Outer God, Yog-Sothoth—” “Was permanently sacrificed in a ritual which but briefly manifested your presence,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose we will discover tomor- row whether anyone took that seriously, when we read the newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the world are banding together in a desperate effort to seal off your incursion into our reality.” They walked on, as the Defence Professor began chuckling, odd throaty sounds. The two of them didn’t talk after that until they came to the Defence Professor’s office, and then the man halted with his hand upon the door. “It is a very strange thing,” the Defence Professor said, his voice now soft again, almost inaudible. The man was not looking at Harry, and Harry saw only his back. “A very strange thing…There was a time when I would have sacrificed a finger from my wand hand, to work upon the bullies of Hogwarts as we have worked upon them this day. To make them fear me as they now fear you, to have the deference of all the students and the adoration of many, I would have given my finger for that. You have everything now that I wanted then. All that I know of human nature says that I should hate you. And yet I do not. It is a very strange thing.” It should have been a touching moment, but instead Harry felt a cold- ness travelling down his spine, as though he were a little fish in the sea, and some vast white shark had just looked him over and decided after a visible hesitation not to eat him. The man opened the door to Defence Professor’s office, and passed within, and was gone. 1178 1179 CH APTER 74 1180 SELF ACTUALIZATION IX: ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS 1181 CH APTER 74 1182 1183 CH APTER 75 1184 SELF ACTUALIZATION X: RESPONSIBILIT Y If you thought they’d be sitting next to each other at dinner time, after that, you’d be quite mistaken. “What does she want from me?” came the plaintive cry of a boy who, for all his extensive reading in the scientific literature, was still a bit naive about certain things. “Did she want to get beaten up?” The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who’d sat down next to him at the dinner table exchanged swift glances with each other. Chosen by some unspoken protocol, the most experienced of their number spoke. “Look,” said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in their com- petition by three witches and a Defence Professor, “the thing you’ve got to understand is, just because she’s angry doesn’t mean you lost points. Miss Granger is angry because she got all frightened and you’re there to be blamed, you understand? But at the same time, even though she won’t admit it, she’ll be touched that her boyfriend went to such ridiculous and frankly insane lengths to protect her.” “This is not about points,” ground out Harry Potter, the words visibly es- caping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner sat ignored on the table in front of him. “This is about justice. And I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!” This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all present. “Yeah, well,” said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, “I think after she kisses you to bring you out of Dementation and you stick forty-four bullies to the ceiling for her, we’ve gone way past ‘she’s not my girlfriend, really’ and into the question of what your kids will be like. Wow, that’s a scary thought…” The Ravenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, “Please don’t look at me like that.” “Look,” said Arty Grey, “I’m sorry to be blunt about this, but you can have justice or you can have girls, you can’t have both at the same time.” He clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder. “You’ve got potential, kid, more potential than any wizard I’ve ever seen, but you’ve got to learn how to use it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your evilness better—not too well, but better. Nice well-groomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but nice well-groomed boys suspected of being secretly Dark get more girls than you can imagine—” “Not interested,” Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy’s hand from his shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it. “But you will be,” said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding. “Ah, you will be!” Elsewhere along the same table— “Romantic?” shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that some of the girls next to her winced. “What part of that was romantic? He didn’t ask! He never asks! He just sends ghosts after people and glues them to ceilings and does whatever he wants with my life!” “But don’t you see?” said a fourth-year witch. “It means that even though he’s evil, he loves you!” “You’re not helping,” said Penelope Clearwater a little further down the table, but she was ignored. Several older witches had started toward Hermione, after she’d sat down at the extreme opposite end of the ta- ble from Harry Potter, but then a swifter cloud of younger girls had sur- rounded Hermione in an impenetrable barrier. “Boys,” said Hermione Granger, “should not be allowed to love girls without asking them first! This is true in a number of ways and especially when it comes to gluing people to the ceiling!” This was also ignored. “It’s just like a play!” sighed a third-year girl. “A play?” said Hermione. “I’d like to see the play where anything like this happens!” “Oh,” said the third-year girl, “I was thinking of that really romantic one where there’s this very nice, sweet boy who makes a Floo call, only he mispronounces his destination and stumbles out into this room full of Dark Wizards who are performing a forbidden ritual that should’ve stayed forever lost to time, and they’re sacrificing seven victims in order to unseal this ancient horror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it’s freed, so of course the boy’s presence interrupts the ritual, and as the horror is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the boy’s last thought is that he wishes he could’ve had a girlfriend, and the next thing you know the boy is lying in the lap of this beautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a dreadful light, only she doesn’t understand any- thing about being human so the boy always has to stop her eating people. This is just like that play, only you’re the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!” “That…” Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. “That actually does sound something like—” “It does?” blurted a second-year girl sitting across the table, who was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet even more fascinated. “No!” said Hermione. “I mean—he’s not my boyfriend!” Two seconds later, Hermione’s ears caught up with what her lips had just said. The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione’s shoulder and gave her a comforting squeeze. “Miss Granger,” she said in a soothing voice, “I think if you’re really honest with yourself, you’ll admit that the real reason you’re angry with your dark master is that he channelled his unspeakable powers through Tracey Davis instead of you.” Hermione’s mouth opened but her throat locked up before the words came out, which was probably a good thing, because if she’d actually yelled that loudly it would’ve broken something. “How’s that possible, actually?” said the third-year girl. “I mean for Harry Potter to work through another girl even though he’s bound himself to you? Do the three of you have one of those, you know, arrangements?” “Gaaaaack,” said Hermione Granger, her throat still locked, her brain halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making a noise like she was coughing up a hairball. 1187 (Later) CH APTER 75 (Even later) And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only person left she could talk to, the only person guaranteed to understand her point of view— “They’re all mad,” said Hermione Granger as she strode vigorously to- ward Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early. “Everyone except you and me, Harry, I mean everyone except us in this whole school of Hog- warts, they’re all entirely mad. And Ravenclaw girls are the worst, I don’t know what Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older, but I’m cer- tain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me if the two of us had soul-bonded, which I’m going to look up in the library tonight, but I’m pretty sure has never actually happened—” “I don’t even know a name for this kind of fallacious reasoning,” said Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which meant he often had to skip forward a few steps to match her own indignation-fuelled speed. “I seriously think if it was up to them, they’d be dragging us off this minute to get our names changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger…Ugh, saying that out loud makes me realize how awful it sounds.” “You mean your name would be Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger and mine would be Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres,” said Hermione. “It’s too horrible to imagine.” “No,” said the boy, “House Potter is a Noble House, so I think that name stays in front—” “What?” she said indignantly. “Who says we have to—” There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of their shoes. “Anyhow,” Hermione said hastily, “some of the crazy things they said at dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say, Harry, that I really am grateful to you for saving me and everybody from getting beaten up, and even though some parts of this afternoon upset me, I’m sure we can just talk about it calmly.” “Ah…” Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes showing a mixture of befuddlement and apprehension, “that’s…good, I guess?” To be specific, there’d been the fourth-year witch explaining that, since Harry was the evil wizard who’d fallen in love with Hermione, and Hermione was the pure and innocent girl who would either redeem him or get seduced by the Dark Arts herself, it followed that Hermione had to be perpetually indignant at anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from certain doom, just so that their romance wouldn’t resolve itself before the end of Act IV. And then Penelope Clear- water, whom Hermione had really thought was smarter than that, had remarked in a loud voice that for identical reasons it was impossible for Hermione to just go over and talk sensibly with Harry about why she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards were attracted to passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This was the point at which Hermione had shoved herself up from the benches, stomped furiously over to where Harry was sitting, and asked him in a reasonable voice if the two of them could go for a walk and sort things out. “So in other words,” Hermione said in her calmest voice ever, “you’re not really in trouble with me, I’m still talking to you, we’re still friends, and we’re still studying together. We’re not having a fight. Right?” Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter’s apprehension. “Right,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “Great!” said Hermione. “So, have you worked out why I was upset, Mr Potter?” There was a pause. “You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?” Harry said cautiously. “I mean—I know you wanted to do things on your own. And I was staying out of your way, until I’d heard you’d been ambushed by three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I wasn’t expecting that. Profes- sor Quirrell wasn’t expecting that. I started to worry you were in over your head and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massed am- bush is way beyond what anyone could handle without help. That’s why I thought you really needed help just that once—” “No, that part’s fine,” said Hermione. “We were in over our heads, hon- estly. Please guess again, Mr Potter.” “Um,” said Harry. “What Tracey did…startled you?” “Startled me, Mr Potter?” There might have been a touch of acidity in her voice. “No, Mr Potter, I was scared. I was frightened. I wouldn’t want to admit to being afraid of just dragons or something, people might think I was cowardly, but when you can hear distant voices crying ‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli- li!’ and there’s pools of blood seeping out from under all the doors, then it’s okay to be scared.” “I am sorry,” Harry said with what sounded like genuine regret. “I thought you’d realize it was me.” “And the reason we all got scared like that, Mr Potter, was that you didn’t ask first!” Despite her intentions, Hermione found her voice was rising again. “You should’ve asked me before you did something like that, Harry! You should’ve said very specifically, ‘Hermione, can I make blood come out from under the doors?’ It’s important to be specific when you’re ask- ing about that sort of thing!” The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. “I…honestly, I just thought you’d have to say no.” “Yes, Mr Potter, I could’ve said no. That’s the whole point of asking first, Mr Potter!” “No, I mean you’d have had to say no, whether or not it was what you really wanted. And then all of you would’ve been beaten up and it would’ve been my fault for asking first.” Hermione’s eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept walk- ing for a few steps while she tried to understand this. “What?” she said. “Well…” the boy said a bit slowly. “I mean…you’re the Sunshine General, aren’t you? You couldn’t say yes to me scaring people, not even bullies, not even to save your friends from getting beaten up. You would’ve had to say no, and then you would’ve been hurt. This way, you can tell people honestly that you had no idea and that it wasn’t your fault. That’s why I didn’t warn you.” Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead of just turning her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said, “Harry, you’ve got to stop coming up with clever reasons for doing stupid things.” Harry’s eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, “Look…I know what you mean, of course, but there’s still the question of whether it actually is a good idea, not just a clever one—” “I understand why you did what you did today,” Hermione said. “But I want you to promise that from now on, you’ll ask me first, always, even if you can come up with a reason why you shouldn’t.” There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her heart sinking. “Hermione—” Harry started to say. “Why?” The frustration burst out into her voice. “Why is it so awful? All you have to do is ask!” Harry’s eyes were very serious. “Who in sphew do you try hardest to defend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you fight?” “Hannah Abbott,” Hermione said without having to think about it, and then felt a little bad, because Hannah was trying hard and she had improved a lot— “Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey, with fi- nal responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you knew Hannah was about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with a plan for protecting her, would you feel good about letting Tracey say whether or not you were al- lowed to do it?” “Well…no?” said Hermione, puzzled. The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. “Would you trust Hannah to have the final say in whether she needed protecting?” “I—” said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew the right answer and she also knew the right answer wasn’t actually true. Han- nah was trying so hard to prove she wasn’t afraid, even though she was, and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff girl might try too hard— Then Hermione realized the implication. “You think I’m like Hannah?” “Not…exactly…” Harry ran his hands through his unruly hair. “Listen, Hermione, what would you have suggested doing, if I’d warned you about an ambush by forty-four bullies?” “I would’ve done the responsible thing and told Professor McGonagall and let her take care of it,” Hermione said promptly. “And then there wouldn’t have been darkness and people screaming and horrible blue light—” But Harry just shook his head. “That’s not the responsible thing to do, Hermione. It’s what someone playing the role of a responsible girl would do. Yes, I thought of going to Professor McGonagall. But she would’ve only stopped the disaster once. Probably before any disturbance happened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew. If the bullies got pun- ished just for plotting, it would be by losing House points, or at worst a day’s detention, not anything that would really scare them. And then the bullies would have tried again. Fewer of them, with better operational se- curity so I didn’t hear about it. They would probably ambush one of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn’t have the authority to do something scary enough to protect you—and she wouldn’t have overstepped her au- thority, because she’s not really responsible.” “Professor McGonagall isn’t responsible?” Hermione said incredulously. She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring at him. “Are you nuts?” The boy didn’t blink. “You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe,” Harry Potter said. “Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever hap- pens, no matter what, it’s always your fault. Even if you tell Professor Mc- Gonagall, she’s not responsible for what happens, you are. Following the school rules isn’t an excuse, someone else being in charge isn’t an excuse, even trying your best isn’t an excuse. There just aren’t any excuses, you’ve got to get the job done no matter what.” Harry’s face tightened. “That’s why I say you’re not thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking that your job is done when you tell Professor McGonagall—that isn’t heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beaten up is okay then, because it isn’t your fault any more. Being a heroine means your job isn’t finished until you’ve done whatever it takes to protect the other girls, permanently.” In Harry’s voice was a touch of the steel he had acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. “You can’t think as if just following the rules means you’ve done your duty.” “I think,” Hermione said evenly, “that you and I might disagree about some things, Mr Potter. Like whether you or Professor McGonagall is more responsible, and whether being responsible usually involves people running around and screaming, and how much it’s a good idea to follow school rules. And just because we disagree, Mr Potter, doesn’t mean that you get the final say.” “Well,” said Harry, “you asked what was so awful about having to ask you first, and it was a surprisingly good question, so I examined my mind and that’s what I found. I think my real fear is that if Hannah is in trouble and I come up with a way to save her that seems weird or dark or some- thing, you might not weigh the consequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine’s responsibility of coming up with some way to save her, somehow, no matter what. Instead you’d just carry out the role of Hermi- one Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and the role of Hermione Gran- ger automatically says no, whether or not she has a better plan in mind. And then forty-four bullies will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it’ll all be my fault because I knew, even if I didn’t want reality to be that way, I knew that was how it would go. I’m pretty sure that was my secret, wordless, unutterable fear.” The frustration was building up inside her again. “It’s my life!” Hermi- one burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry mess- ing with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to her objections. She shouldn’t have to win an argu- ment just to—“There’ll always be some reason, you can always say I’m not thinking right! I want my own life! Otherwise I’ll walk away, I really will, I mean it Harry.” Harry sighed. “This is exactly where I didn’t want things to end up, and here we are. You’re afraid of just the same thing I am, aren’t you? Afraid that if you let go of the steering wheel, we’ll crash.” The corners of his lips twisted, but it didn’t look like a real smile. “That’s something I can understand.” “I don’t think you understand at all!” Hermione said sharply. “You said we’d be partners, Harry!” That stopped him, she could see it stop him. “How about this?” Harry said at last. “I’ll promise to ask you first be- fore I do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in your affairs. Only you’ve got to promise me to be reasonable, Hermione. I mean really, genuinely, stop and think for twenty seconds first, treat it as a real choice. The sort of reasonableness where you realize I’m offering a way to protect the other girls, and that if you automatically say no without considering it properly, there’s this actual consequence where Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital.” Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound up. “Well?” said Harry. “I shouldn’t have to make promises,” she said, “just to be consulted about my own life.” She turned from Harry and began walking toward the Ravenclaw tower, not looking at him. “But I’ll think about it, anyway.” She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for a while, passing through an archway of some reddish metal like copper, into a corridor that was just like the one they’d left except that it was tiled with pentagons instead of squares. “Hermione…” said Harry. “I’ve been watching you and thinking, since the day you said you were going to be a hero. You’ve got the courage. You’ll fight for what’s right, even in the face of enemies that would scare other people away. You’ve certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you’re probably a better person inside than I am. But even so…well, to be hon- est, Hermione…I can’t quite see you filling Dumbledore’s shoes, leading magical Britain’s fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet, anyway.” Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on walking, as though lost in thought. Fill those shoes? She’d never tried to imagine herself that way. She’d never imagined imagining herself that way. “And maybe I’m wrong,” Harry said as they walked. “Maybe I’ve just read too many stories where the heroes never do the sensible thing and follow the rules and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so my brain doesn’t think you’re a proper storybook hero. Maybe it’s you who’s the sane one, Hermione, and me who’s just being silly. But every time you talk about fol- lowing rules or relying on teachers, I get that same feeling, like it’s bound up with this one last thing that’s stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC self to sleep and turns you into an NPC again…” Harry let out a sigh. “Maybe that’s why Dumbledore said I should have wicked step- parents.” “He said what?” Harry nodded. “I still don’t know whether the Headmaster was joking or…the thing is, he was right in a way. I had loving parents, but I never felt like I could trust their decisions, they weren’t sane enough. I always knew that if I didn’t think things through myself, I might get hurt. Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done if I’m there to nag her about it, she doesn’t break rules on her own without heroic su- pervision. Professor Quirrell really is someone who gets things done no matter what, and he’s the only other person I know who notices stuff like the Snitch ruining Quidditch. But him I can’t trust to be good. Even if it’s sad, I think that’s part of the environment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero—people who don’t have anyone else to shove final responsibil- ity onto, and that’s why they form the mental habit of tracking everything themselves.” Hermione didn’t say anything to that, but she was thinking back to something Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very short autobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because the scroll had been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before the Muggle print- ing press had inspired wizards to invent the Reading-Writing Quill. No rescuer hath the rescuer, Godric Gryffindor had written. No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father, nothing above. If that was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn’t sure she wanted to pay it. Or maybe—though it wasn’t the sort of thing she would have thought, before she started hanging around Harry—maybe Godric Gryf- findor had got it wrong. “Do you trust Dumbledore?” Hermione said. “I mean, he’s right here in our school and he’s the most legendary hero in the whole world—” “He was the most legendary hero,” said Harry. “Now he sets chickens on fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to you?” Hermione didn’t answer. Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral stairs, the steps alternating between bronze metal and blue stone; the final ap- proach to where the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard their dorm with silly riddles. “Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you,” Harry said when they were about halfway up. “Since it affects your life and all. Think of it as a sort of down payment—” “What is it?” said Hermione. “I predict sphew is about to retire.” “Retire?” Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of the stairs. “Yeah,” Harry said. “I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the teach- ers are about to clamp down hard on fighting in the corridors.” Harry was grinning as he spoke, a glint in his eyes behind the glasses hinting at se- cret knowledge. “Cast new wards to detect offensive hexes, or start veri- fying reports of bullying using Veritaserum—I can think of several ways they might shut it down. But if I’m right, it’s something to celebrate, Her- mione, you and all of you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that you got them to actually do something about the bullying. All the bullying.” Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she reached the top of the stairs and began walking toward the Ravenclaw portrait for her riddle, Hermione felt rather lighter on her feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading through her like she’d been pumped full of helium. Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in, she hadn’t expected that much, she hadn’t expected it to actually work. They’d made a difference… 1196 SELF ACTUALIZATION X: RESPONSIBILIT Y 1197 CH APTER 75 1198 SELF ACTUALIZATION X: RESPONSIBILIT Y Non est salvatori salvator, neque defensori dominus, nec pater nec mater, nihil supernum. —Godric Gryffindor, 1202 C.E. CHAPTER SE V ENT Y-SIX INTERLUDE WITH THE CONFESSOR: SUNK COSTS Rianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and crude mortar, keeping a Lumos lit through the distances between fire- sconces, holding aloft her wand through the gaps from light to light. She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings, lit by a torch of ancient style that fired as she entered. There was no-one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of ner- vous standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned sofa large enough for two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on. A simple wooden stool would have been easier, she could have done that in fifteen seconds, but—well— Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still hadn’t arrived, and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with her pulse ham- mering in her throat. Somehow she was only becoming more nervous, not less, as the delay stretched. She knew this was the last time. The last time before all these memories went away, and Rianne Felthorne found herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what was going on. There was something about it that felt like dying. The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn’t harmful, people forgot things all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up without remembering their dreams. Obliviation didn’t even involve that much discontinuity, just a brief instant of disorientation; it was like being distracted by a loud noise and losing track of a thought you couldn’t seem to remember afterwards. That was what the books said, and why Memory Charms were fully approved by the Ministry for all authorized governmental purposes. But still, these thoughts, the thoughts she was thinking right now; soon nobody would have them any more. When she looked ahead in the future, there was nobody to complete the thoughts she wasn’t finished thinking. Even if she managed to tie up all the loose ends in her mind over the next minute, there wouldn’t be anything left of it afterwards. Wasn’t that ex- actly what you would find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to die in the next minute? There came the sound of muffled steps… Severus Snape emerged into the cavern. His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange expression crossed his face; strange because it wasn’t sardonic, or angry, or cold. “Thank you, Miss Felthorne,” Snape said quietly, “that was considerate of you.” The Potions Master took out his wand and performed the usual privacy Charms, and then he moved toward her, and sat down heavily beside her on the Transfigured sofa. Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely. She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his head was leaning back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed. Not sleeping, though. His face appeared tense, in pain. She knew—she was suddenly certain—that she was only allowed to see this sight because she wouldn’t remember it afterwards; and that no- body before her had ever been allowed to see it. The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne’s mind sounded something like this: I could just lean over and kiss him, you are com- pletely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed I bet he wouldn’t stop me in time, I bet it would be years before anyone found your body— But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner disappoint- ment and relief), and said, in a more normal voice, “Your payment, Miss Felthorne.” From his robe he took a ruby, cut to Gringotts standard, and held it out toward her. “Fifty facets. I will not mind if you count them.” She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press the ruby into her fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin alive against hers— But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby into her hand, then leaned back against the couch. “You will remember find- ing it lying on the ground of this cavern, where you came exploring,” said Snape. “And since nobody except you will actually believe that, you will remember thinking that it would be less troublesome if you deposited the money into a separate box in Gringotts.” For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the torch. “Why—” Rianne Felthorne said. He knows I won’t remember. “Why did you do it? I mean—you said to tell you where bullies would be, and who they would be, but not whether Granger would be there. And I know, the way the Time-Turner works, if you want to make Granger be there, you can’t be told whether it’s already happened. So I did work out that we were the ones telling her where to go. We were, weren’t we?” Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again. “But,” said Rianne, “I didn’t understand why you were helping her. And now—after what you did to Granger in the Great Hall—I just don’t understand at all.” Rianne had never thought of herself as particularly nice. She’d taken little notice of the controversy over the Sunshine Gen- eral. But something about helping Granger fight bullies had…well, she’d got used to thinking of that as the good side, and thinking of herself as being on the good side. And she’d found she actually liked it. It was hard, to just let that go. “Why’d you do that, Professor Snape?” Snape shook his head, his face tightened. “Is—” Rianne said falteringly. “I mean—so long as we’re here—is there anything you do want to talk about?” There was something she wanted to say, but she couldn’t make the words pass her own lips. “I can think of one matter,” Snape said after a pause. “If you are inter- ested, Miss Felthorne.” Snape’s eyes were still shut, so she couldn’t just nod her head. Her voice almost broke, when she forced herself to say “Yes.” “There’s a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss Felthorne,” Snape said from behind his closed eyes. “I won’t say his name. But he watches you every time you walk across the room, when he thinks you aren’t looking. He dreams about you and desires to possess you, but he’s never asked you for so much as a kiss.” Her heart started hammering even harder. “Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you think of that boy?” “Well—” she said. She was stumbling over her words. “I think—to never even ask for one kiss—would be—” Sad. Just too pitiful. “Weakness,” she said, her voice trembling. “I agree,” said Snape. “Suppose that boy had helped you, though. Would you think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?” She inhaled sharply— “Or would you think,” Snape continued, his eyes still closed, “that he was just being bothersome?” The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn’t help gasping out loud. Snape’s eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the sofa. Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles. “No, not you, Miss Felthorne!” Snape said. “Not you! We really are talk- ing about a boy. One who attends your Potions class, in fact.” “Oh,” she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said before, now feeling rather unnerved as she thought of some boy watching her, always silently watching. “Well, um, in that case. That’s kind of creepy, ac- tually. Who is it?” The Potions Master shook his head. “It doesn’t matter,” said Snape. “Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were still in love with you years later?” “Um,” she said, feeling a bit confused, “that would be totally pathetic?” The torch crackled a bit in the cavern. “It’s strange,” Snape said quietly. “I have had two mentors, over the course of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive, and neither ever told me the things I wasn’t seeing. It’s clear enough why the first said noth- ing, but the second…” Snape’s face tightened. “I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask why he stayed silent.” The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of some- thing to say. “It is an odd thing,” Snape said, his voice still softer, “to look back af- ter only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life was ruined past all rescuing. Was it determined when the Sorting Hat cried ‘Slytherin!’ for me? It seems unfair, since I was offered no choice; the Sorting Hat spoke the moment it touched upon my head. Yet I cannot claim it named me un- truly. I never treasured knowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal to the one person I called friend. I was never one for righteous fury, then or now. Courage? There is no bravery in risking a life already ruined. My little fears have always mastered me, and I never turned aside from any of the paths I walked down on account of those little fears. No, the Sorting Hat could never have put me in her House. Perhaps my final loss was determined, even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the Sorting Hat speaks truly? Is it fair that some children should possess more courage than others, and thus a man’s life be judged?” Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she’d never had the tini- est inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and unfortunately all these dark hidden depths weren’t helping her with her problem. “But no,” Snape said. “I know where it went wrong for the last time. I could point to the very day and hour I missed my final chance. Miss Felthorne, did the Sorting Hat offer you Ravenclaw?” “Y-yes,” she said without thinking. “Have you ever been any good at riddles?” “Yes,” she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was about to say, she wouldn’t hear it if she said no. “I am terrible at riddles,” Snape said in a distant voice. “I was once given a riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the simplest part until too late. I did not even realize the riddle was meant for me until too late. I thought I had merely happened to overhear it, when in truth it was I who was overheard. So I sold my riddle to another, and that is when the wreckage of my life passed beyond retrieval.” Snape’s voice was still distant, sounding more abstracted than sorrowful. “And even now, I un- derstand nothing of importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose a man were carrying a knife, and he tripped over a baby and stabbed himself. Would you say that the baby had,” Snape’s voice lowered, as though he were imitating some still deeper voice, “the power to vanquish him?” “Um…no?” she said hesitantly. “Then what does it mean to have the power to vanquish someone?” Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time in her life, that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with her parents’ dis- approval; but the Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor.) “Well…” Rianne said. She was having trouble putting her thoughts into words. “It means you’ve got the power, but you don’t have to do it. It means you could do it if you tried—” “Choice,” the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, as though he wasn’t really talking to her at all. “There will be a choice. That is what the riddle seems to imply. And that choice is not a foregone conclusion to the chooser, for the riddle does not say, will vanquish, but rather the power to vanquish. How would a grown man mark a baby as his equal?” “What?” said Rianne. She didn’t understand that at all. “Marking a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would produce a last- ing scar. But such may be done to any child. What mark would signify that a baby was your equal?” She answered with the first thought that came to mind. “If you signed a betrothal contract, that would mean you’d be equals with them some day, when they grew up and you got married.” “That…” said Snape. “That’s probably not it, Miss Felthorne, but thank you for trying.” The long delicate fingers, honed by stirring potions to unimaginably fine tolerances, reached up and rubbed at the temples of the man’s forehead. “It is enough to drive me to madness, so much hing- ing on such fragile words. Power he knows not…it must be more than some unknown spell. Not something he could acquire simply by practice and study. Some innate talent? No-one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus… and yet that hardly seems like a power he knows not. Nor can I see how either could destroy all but a remnant of the other; I can see it in one di- rection, but not the reverse…” The Potions Master sighed. “And none of this means anything to you, does it, Miss Felthorne? The words are noth- ing. The words are shadows. It is her intonation which carries the meaning and that is something I’ve never been able to…” The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him. “A prophecy?” Rianne said in a high squeak. “You heard a prophecy?” She’d taken Divination for a couple of months before dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about how it worked. “I will try one last thing,” said Snape. “Something I have not tried be- fore. Miss Felthorne, listen to the sound of my voice, the way I say it, not the words themselves, and tell me what you think it means. Can you do that? Good,” said Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn’t sure at all what she was supposed to do. And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, “for those two dif- ferent spellets cannot exist in the same vuld.” It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the hollow words had been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy. Unnerved, she blurted out the first thing which came to mind, which might have been influenced by her present company. “Those two different ingredients can- not exist in the same cauldron?” “But why not, Miss Felthorne? What is the meaning of a statement like that? What are we really being told?” “Ah…” she hazarded. “If the two ingredients mix, they’ll catch fire and burn the cauldron?” Snape’s face did not change expression in the slightest. “Perhaps,” Snape finally said, after they’d sat on the sofa in awful silence for what seemed like minutes. “It would explain the word must. Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have been most helpful.” “I—” she said, “I was glad to—” and the words stuck in her throat. The Potions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality, and she knew that the time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered these moments was drawing to an end. “I wish I didn’t have to forget this, Professor Snape!” “I wish,” Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could hardly hear it, “that everything had been different…” The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his presence vanishing from beside her. He turned and drew his wand from his robes, pointing it at her. “Wait—” she said. “Before that—” Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from fantasy to reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only one step and would never go any further. The gap stretched like the distance between two mountains. The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor… …was it fair that thus a woman’s life be judged? If you can’t say it now, when you won’t even remember it afterwards—when nothing will continue from this moment, just as if you were to die—then when will you ever say it, to anyone? “Can I have a kiss first?” said Rianne Felthorne. Snape’s black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush started to reach all the way to her chest, and she wondered if he knew perfectly well that she was still being weak, and it wasn’t a kiss she’d truly wanted. “Why not,” the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his head down over the sofa and kissed her. It was nothing like she’d imagined. In her fantasies Snape’s kisses were fierce, seized from her, but this was—it was just awkward, actually. Snape’s lips pressed down too hard on hers, forcing them back against her teeth, and the angle wasn’t right and their noses were sort of bending and his lips were too tight and— Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising his wand once more, did she realize. “That wasn’t—” she said in a wondering voice, looking up at him. “That wasn’t—was it—your first—” Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she’d discovered, still holding the extraordinary ruby she’d found embedded in the dirt of one corner. It was an incredible windfall, and she didn’t know why looking at the ruby made her feel so sad, like she’d forgotten something, something that had been precious to her. CHAPTER SE V ENT Y-SE V EN SE LF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and— The old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the Head- master’s office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices; his robes a gentle yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he ordinarily wore before others. His wrinkled hand held a quill scratching away at an official-looking parchment. If you had somehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been unable to deduce anything more about the man himself than you understood of the enigmatic devices. You might have observed that the face looked a little sad, a little tired, but then Albus Dumbledore always looked like that when he was alone. In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes with no spark of flame, a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to stop existing. On the material plane, the great oaken door to the office had been closed and locked; beyond that door, the Endless Stairs stayed motionless; at the bottom of those stairs, the gargoyles that blocked the entrance did not flow, their pseudo-life withdrawn to leave solid rock. Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word, even as it was in the middle of scratching a letter— The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have shocked anyone watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall onto the parchment; like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his yellow robes whirling around him and a wand of dread power leaping into his hand— And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even as the wand came to bear. A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking. More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the duelling holster strapped beneath the old wizard’s sleeve. The ancient man moved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more formal stance, composed his face. Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to the side of the parchment, as though it had been carefully placed there rather than dropped in haste; and the parchment itself flipped over to show blankness. With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open. Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him. “I admit that I am impressed, Harry,” the old wizard said quietly. “The Cloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my lesser means of vision; but I did not sense my golems step aside, nor the stairs turning. How did you come here?” The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until the door closed smoothly behind him. “I can go anywhere I choose, with or without permission,” the boy said. His voice seemed calm; too calm, perhaps. “I am in your office because I decided to be here, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly mistaken, Headmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay in this school because I am a prisoner here. I simply have not chosen, yet, to leave. Now keeping that in mind, why did you command your agent, Professor Snape, to break the agreement we made in this office, that he would not torment any student in her fourth year or below?” The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment. Then, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers drew open one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a sheet of parch- ment, laid it upon the desk. “Fourteen,” the old wizard said. “It is not the number of all the owls sent last night. Only the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot, or families of great wealth, or families already allied with your foes. Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father, Lord Jugson, is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater who died by Alastor Moody’s wand. What the letters said, I do not know, but I can guess. Do you still not understand, Harry Potter? Each time Her- mione Granger won, as you put it, the danger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again. But now the Slytherins have triumphed over her, eas- ily and safely, without violence or lasting harm. They have won, and need fight no more…” The old wizard sighed. “So I had planned. So I had hoped. So it would have been, if the Defence Professor had not taken it upon him- self to intervene. Now the dispute goes to the Board of Governors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defence Professor; but that will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it will not have been over and finished in a moment, to their satisfaction.” The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back further to look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was like the boy was looking down at the Headmaster, rather than up. “So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?” the boy said softly. “Good. His life is already bought and paid for, then, and I can do anything I want to him without ethical problems—” “Harry!” The boy’s voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from some un- touched spring. “You seem to think that the Light should live in fear of the darkness. I say it should be the other way around. I’d prefer not to kill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a Death Eater. But one hour of brain- storming with the Defence Professor would be plenty of time to come up with some creative way to wreck him financially, or get him exiled from magical Britain. That would serve to make the point, I think.” “I confess,” the old wizard said slowly, “that the thought of ruining a five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death Eater to fight to the finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway, had not occurred to me, Harry.” The old wizard lifted a finger to push back his half-moon glasses from where they had slid a little down his nose, during his sudden mo- tion earlier. “I dare say it would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor McGonagall, nor to Fred and George.” The boy shrugged. “It wouldn’t be about the hallways,” the boy said. “It would be justice for his past crimes, and I’d only do it if Jugson made the first move. The point isn’t to make people scared of me as a wild card, after all. It’s to teach them that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking me with a stick is incredibly dangerous.” The boy smiled in a way that didn’t reach his eyes. “Maybe I’ll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, say- ing that anyone who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn the true meaning of Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be fine.” “No,” the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now, showing some- thing of his true age and power. “No, Harry, that must not be. You have not yet learned the meaning of fighting, what truly happens when foes meet in battle. And so you dream, as young boys do, of teaching your foes to fear you. It frightens me that you, at far too young an age, might al- ready have enough power to make some part of your dreams into reality. There is no turning of that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry, none. That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain.” The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty golden platform where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a gesture that few would have caught, but the old wizard knew it very well. “All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me,” the boy said then. His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had gone from it. “I still don’t think you should let children get hurt out of fear of what some- one like Lord Jugson might do. Protecting them is the whole point of your job. If Lord Jugson really does try to get in your way, then do whatever it takes to stop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and I’ll take per- sonal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning bullies in Hogwarts, whether it’s Lord Jugson or anyone else.” Slowly the old wizard shook his head. “You seem to think, Harry, that I need merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept aside. You are wrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, through the Daily Prophet he sways all Britain, only by bare margins does he not control enough of the Board of Governors to oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are allies, but even they would step aside if they saw us acting wantonly. The world that surrounds you is more fragile than you seem to believe, and we must walk with greater care. The old Wizarding War never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different form; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chess pieces for a time. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to take a pawn of his colour?” The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. “Okay, I’ll figure out some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson betrayed his own side.” “Harry—” “Obstacles mean you get creative, Headmaster. It doesn’t mean you abandon the children you’re supposed to protect. Let the Light win, and if trouble comes of it—” The boy shrugged. “Let Light win again.” “So might phœnixes speak, if they had words,” the old wizard said. “But you do not understand the phœnix’s price.” The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that seemed to echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise seemed to come from all around them. Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat’s hat rack, the stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring itself into two framing columns and revealing a gap between them, an opening that showed a set of stone stairs leading upward into darkness. The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then looked back at where Harry Potter stood. “Come!” said the old wizard. There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes. “Since you have already gone so far as to force your way here uninvited, you may as well go further.” 1213 CH APTER 7 7 1214 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES 1215 CH APTER 7 7 1216 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES 1217 CH APTER 7 7 1218 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened, and his face changed. “In other words,” the boy said, as though talking to himself without any other people in the room, “it’s already known how to keep powerful Dark Wizards in prison, without using Dementors. People know they know that.” “Harry…?” “No,” the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing like green fire. “I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes gave me a mission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to me, and not to you. You are willing to accept balances of power where the bad guys end up winning. I am not.” “That too is not an answer,” the old wizard said; his face showed noth- ing of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing pain. “Refusing to ac- cept something does not change it. I wonder now if you are simply too young to understand this matter, Harry, despite your outward airs; only in children’s fantasies can all battles be won, and not a single evil toler- ated.” “And that’s why I can destroy Dementors and you can’t,” said the boy. “Because I believe that the darkness can be broken.” The old wizard’s breath stopped in his throat. “The phœnix’s price isn’t inevitable,” the boy said. “It’s not part of some deep balance built into the universe. It’s just the parts of the problem where you haven’t figured out yet how to cheat.” The old wizard’s lips parted, and no words came forth. Silver light falling on shattered wands. “Fawkes gave me a mission,” the boy repeated, “and I will carry out that mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it. That’s the part of the answer that you’re missing. You don’t stop and say, oh well, guess I can’t possibly figure out any way to stop bullying in Hogwarts, and leave it at that. You just keep looking until you figure out how to do it. If that requires breaking Lucius Malfoy’s entire conspiracy, fine.” “And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?” the old wizard said in an unsteady voice. “What will you do to win that, Harry? Will you break the whole world? Even if some day you gain such power, you are not yet beyond prices, and perhaps you never will be! For you to act this way now is nothing short of madness!” “I asked Professor Quirrell why he’d laughed,” the boy said evenly, “af- ter he awarded Hermione those hundred points. And Professor Quirrell said, these aren’t his exact words, but it’s pretty much what he said, that he’d found it tremendously amusing that the great and good Albus Dum- bledore had been sitting there doing nothing as this poor innocent girl begged for help, while he had been the one to defend her. And he told me then that by the time good and moral people were done tying themselves up in knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they did act, you could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad. Whereas he could help innocent girls any time he felt like it, because he wasn’t a good per- son. And that I ought to remember that, any time I considered growing up to be good.” The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight widen- ing of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been watching him very closely. “Don’t worry, Headmaster,” said the boy. “I haven’t got my wires crossed. I know that I’m supposed to learn goodness from Hermione and Fawkes, not from Professor Quirrell and you. Which brings me to the actual reason why I came here. Hermione’s time is too valuable to waste in detentions. Professor Snape will revoke it, claiming that I blackmailed him.” After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver beard swaying slowly beneath. “That would not be best for her, Harry,” the old wizard said. “But the detention can be put down as being served with Pro- fessor Binns, and you and she can study together in his classroom.” “Fine,” the boy said. “I think that was all the business we had together, in the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be working on the side of the bad guys or letting them win, that I will do whatever I think Fawkes would tell me to, regardless of how much trouble comes of it. I hope we’re both clear on that.” Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room, through the open door of black metal, the words “Lumos!” and the light of his wand following a moment later. The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the lives which his own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose, shaking, to touch at his half-moon glasses— The boy poked his head back in. “Would you mind switching on the stairs, Headmaster? I’d rather not go through all the work again to leave the same way I came.” “Go, Harry Potter,” the old wizard said. “The stairs will receive you.” (Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly waited next to the gargoyles since 9 p.m., followed the Deputy Head- mistress through the opening that parted for her, stood quietly behind her on the turning stairs until they came to the top, and then, still under the Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.) 12 2 2 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES 12 23 CH APTER 7 7 12 24 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and— A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little chromatic- ity of its own which sent back the infringing light in splintered reflec- tions, iridescent in many colours, as it fractured the shine of the many- splendoured chandeliers of the Slytherin common room. Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of a young witch who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any of Professor Quirrell’s armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at best in her Defence class, who could not have cast a Prismatic Barrier even to save her own life. “Oh, stop it,” said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored despite the sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he kept his wand pointed at the barrier that was sheltering Millicent Bulstrode. He couldn’t remember making the decision, there’d just been the two older boys about to hex Millicent, the common room silently staring, and then Draco’s hand had just drawn his wand and cast the barrier, leaving his heart to pump itself full of shocked adrenaline while his poor sad brain frantically racked itself for explanations— The two older boys were straightening up from where they’d been looming over Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a mixture of shock and anger. Gregory and Vincent beside him had already drawn their own wands, but weren’t pointing them. All three of them together couldn’t have won, anyway. But the older boys wouldn’t hex him. Nobody could possibly be stupid enough to hex the next Lord Malfoy. It wasn’t fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat beneath his robes, as he desperately hoped the beads of water weren’t visible on his forehead. Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening certainty that even if he got away with this now, if he kept down this path, there would come a time when it would all come crashing down; and then he might not be the next Lord Malfoy any more. “Mr Malfoy,” said the oldest-looking boy. “Why are you protecting her?” “So you’ve located the mistress of the conspiracy,” Draco said with a Number Two Sneer, “and it’s, let me get this straight now, a first-year girl named Millicent Bulstrode. She’s just a conduit, you nitwit!” “So?” demanded the older boy. “She still helped them!” Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still talk- ing in a bored voice, Draco said, “Did you know what you were doing, Miss Bulstrode?” “N-no,” Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at her desk. “Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing on were going to?” “No!” said Millicent. “Thank you,” Draco said. “All of you please leave her alone, she’s just a pawn. Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favour you did me in Febru- ary to have been repaid.” And Draco turned back to his Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and back again that Millicent didn’t say anything incred- ibly stupid like ‘What favour?’— “Then why,” a voice said clearly from across the room, “did those witches go where a note from Millicent told them to go?” Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where Ran- dolph Lee had spoken. “What did the fake note say exactly?” said Draco. “Was it, ‘I command you to go forth in the name of the Dark Lady Bul- strode’ or ‘Please meet me here, sincerely Millicent?’” Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second— “I thought so,” said Draco. “That wasn’t a very good test, Mr Lee, it—it can—” A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he figured out how to say it without using Harry-words like false positive. “It can get the witches to go there if any of them is just friends with Millicent.” As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked down again at his Potions homework, ignoring (except for the feeling of sick dread in his stomach) the whispers from around the room. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory staring at him. 12 27 CH APTER 7 7 12 28 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES 12 29 CH APTER 7 7 1230 SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AFTERMATHS: SURFACE APPEARANCES Aftermath: Hermione Granger and— Being invisible should’ve been more interesting than this, the corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in strange colours or something. But actually, Hermione thought, being under Harry’s invisibility cloak was exactly like not being under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloak part. When you pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and over your face, you couldn’t even see it stretching in front of you, and after- wards it didn’t seem to impede your breathing. And the world looked just the same, except that when you walked past things of metal, you didn’t see any small reflections of yourself. Portraits never looked at you, only did whatever strange things they did when they were alone. Hermione hadn’t tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn’t sure she wanted to. Most of all, there was no you any more as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just a changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not so much of being invisible as of not existing. Harry hadn’t questioned her at all, she’d just got out the word ‘invis- ibility’ and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak from his pouch. She hadn’t even been given a chance to explain about her extremely se- cret meeting with Daphne and Millicent Bulstrode, or that she thought it would help protect the other girls, Harry had just handed over what was probably a Deathly Hallow. If you were fair, and she did try to be fair, she had to admit that sometimes Harry could be a true, true friend. The secret meeting itself had been a total failure. Millicent had claimed to be a seer. Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at consid- erable length that this could not possibly be true. She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their research; Harry had insisted that they read everything they could find about prophecies that wasn’t in the Restricted Section. As Harry had observed, it would save a lot of effort if they could just get a seer to prophesy every- thing they would figure out thirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry’s terms, any means of obtaining information transmitted from the distant future was potentially an instant global victory condition.) But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn’t con- trollable, there was no way to ask for a prophecy about anything in partic- ular. Instead (the books had said) there was a sort of pressure that built up in Time, when some huge event was trying to happen, or stop itself from happening. And seers were like weak points that let out the pressure, when the right listener was nearby. So prophecies were only about big, important things, because only that generated enough pressure; and you almost never got more than one seer saying the same thing, because af- terwards the pressure was gone. And, as Hermione had further explained to Millicent, the seers themselves didn’t remember their prophecies, be- cause the message wasn’t for them. And the messages would come out in riddles, and only someone who heard the prophecy in the seer’s original voice would hear all the meaning that was in the riddle. There was no pos- sible way that Millicent could just give out a prophecy any time she wanted, about school bullies, and then remember it, and if she had it would’ve come out as ‘the skeleton is the key’ and not ‘Susan Bones has to be there’. Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so Hermi- one had relaxed her fists where they’d been jammed on her hips, calmed herself down, and stated carefully that she was glad Millicent had helped them, but they had sometimes walked into traps following what Millicent said, and so Hermione really did want to know where the messages had actually come from. And Millicent had said in a small voice: But, but she told me that she was a seer… Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had refused to give up her source. It wasn’t just that Hermione had felt awful about the scared look on Millicent’s face. It was that Hermione had a strong feeling that if they did find the person who’d been telling Millicent things, why, they would turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in the morning. She was getting that same despairing feeling she’d had in the battle be- fore Christmas, looking at Zabini’s charts with all the coloured lines and boxes and…and she had only just now realized what it meant that Zabini had been the one showing her that chart. Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having your life get overly complicated. Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps pro- truding from a central spine, a poorly-kept “secret” staircase that was ac- tually one of the fastest ways from the Slytherin dungeons to the Raven- claw tower, but which only witches could traverse. (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to move between Ravenclaw and Slytherin was some- thing Hermione found a bit puzzling.) At the top of the staircase, now that she was away from Slytherin, Hermione stopped and took off Harry’s invisibility cloak. After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right and started to walk down a short passageway, now automatically keep- ing an eye out in all directions without really thinking about it, and her constantly-scanning eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove— (fleeting disorientation) —and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any conscious de- cision her wand had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at… …a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to deter- mine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath. “Hello again, Hermione,” whispered a sibilant voice from beneath the black hat, from behind the black mist. Hermione’s heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest, her witch’s robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin, there was a taste of fear already in her mouth; she didn’t know why she was so sud- denly filled up with adrenaline but her hand gripped harder on her wand. “Who are you?” Hermione demanded. The hat tilted slightly; the whispering voice, when it came forth from the black mist, sounded dry as dust. “The last ally,” spoke the sibilant whis- per. “The one who finally answers, when no other will answer you. I am perhaps the only true friend you have in all Hogwarts, Hermione. For you have now seen how the others stayed silent when you were in need—” “What’s your name?” The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn’t look like shoul- ders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug. “That is the riddle, young Raven- claw. Until you solve it, you may call me whatever you wish.” She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the spiral grooves on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip on the wood. “Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person,” Hermione said, “what do you want with me?” “That is the wrong question,” came the whisper from black mist. “You should ask, rather, what I can offer you.” “No,” the young girl said quite steadily, “I don’t think I should be asking that, actually.” A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. “Not power,” whispered the voice, “not wealth, you care little for such things, do you, young Ravenclaw? Knowledge. That is what I possess. I know what is un- folding within this school, all the hidden plans and players, the answers of the riddle. I know the true reason for the coldness you see in Harry Potter’s eyes. I know the true nature of Professor Quirrell’s mysterious illness. I know who Dumbledore truly fears.” “Good for you,” said Hermione Granger. “But do you know how many licks it takes to get to the biscuit centre of a Twix?” The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded lower when it spoke, disappointed. “So you are not even curious, young Raven- claw, about the truths behind the lies?” “One hundred and eighty-seven,” she said. “I tried it once and that’s how many it came out to.” Her hand was almost slipping on her wand, there was a sense of fatigue in her fingers like she’d been holding the wand for hours instead of minutes— The voice hissed, “Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater.” Hermione almost dropped her wand. “Ah,” the voice whispered in satisfaction. “I thought that might in- terest you. So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like to know about your enemies, or those you call friends?” She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black cloak, frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape was a Death Eater? Who would tell her something like that, why, what was going on? “That’s—” Hermione said. Her voice was quavering. “That’s extremely serious business, if it’s really true. Why are you telling something like that to me, and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?” “Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape,” the black mist whispered. “You saw it, Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the top. Everything that is wrong with this school, it all begins with the mad Headmaster. You alone dared to criticise him for it—and therefore I speak to you.” “And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?” Hermione said, keeping her voice as even as she could. If this was his helpful ghost— The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head. “I am frightened of Harry Potter,” it whispered. “Of the coldness in his eyes, of the darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter is a killer, and anyone who is an obstacle to him will die. Even you, Hermione Granger, if you dare truly oppose him, the darkness behind his eyes will reach out and destroy you. This I know.” “Then you don’t know half of what you pretend to know,” Hermione said, her voice a little firmer. “I’m scared of Harry too. But not because of what he might ever do to me. I’m scared of what he might do to protect me—” “Wrong.” The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no possibility of denial. “Harry Potter will turn against you in time, Hermione, when the darkness takes him fully. He will not shed a tear, he will not even notice, on the day his footsteps finally crush you underneath.” “Double wrong!” she said back in a rising voice, even though there were chills going down her spine. One of Harry’s phrases came to her. “Just what do you think you know, and how do you think you know it, anyway?” “Time—” The voice seemed to catch itself. “Time enough for that later. For now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy. And yet you are in gravest danger.” “I can believe that,” said Hermione Granger. She desperately wanted to shift her wand to her other hand, she felt like she needed to grab her right arm just to keep it up, her head ached like she’d been staring at the black mist for days; she didn’t know why she’d tired so quickly. “Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione.” The whisper had risen, departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of audible concern. “You have humiliated Slytherin House, you have defeated his son in battle. Even before then you were an embarrassment to all who stand with the Death Eaters; for you are a Muggle-born and yet you possess a power of wizardry greater than any pureblood. And now you are becoming known, the eyes of the world on you. Lucius Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione, to hurt you and perhaps even kill you, and he has the means to do it!” The whisper had grown urgent. There was a pause. “Is that all?” Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or Harry Pot- ter, she’d probably be asking clever questions to gather more information; but her mind felt slow and fatigued. She really needed to get out of here and go lie down for a while. “You don’t believe me,” the whisper said, softer and sadder now. “Why not, Hermione? I am trying to help you.” Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove. “Why not, Hermione?” demanded the voice, rising to a hiss. “You owe me that much! Tell me, and then—” The voice caught, and came back quieter. “And then you can go, I suppose. Only tell me—why—” Maybe she shouldn’t’ve answered; maybe she should’ve just turned and fled, or better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then screamed at the top of her lungs as she ran; but it was the note of real pain in the voice that caught her, and so she answered. “Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,” Hermi- one said, keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level on the tower- ing black cloak and the faceless black mist. “That’s all?” whispered the voice incredulously. Sadness seemed to in- fuse it. “I hoped for better from you, Hermione. Surely such a Ravenclaw as you, the most intelligent Ravenclaw to grace Hogwarts in a generation, knows that appearances can be misleading.” “Oh, I know it,” said Hermione. She took another step back, her tired fingers tightening on the wand. “But the thing that people forget some- times, is that even though appearances can be misleading, they’re usually not.” There was a pause. “You are the clever one,” said the voice, and the black mist evaporated away, no longer obscuring; she saw the face beneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline bursting through her— (fleeting disorientation) —and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex over her whole body, she found that without any thought or any conscious de- cision her wand had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at… …a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as though in invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were visible, her face hidden beneath a white veil; and she was glowing all over, not like a ghost, not transparent, just surrounded by soft white light. Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering why her heart was already hammering, and why she felt so scared. “Hello again, Hermione,” the kindly whisper emanated from the white glow behind the veil. “I’ve been sent to help you, so please don’t be afraid. I am your servant in all things; for you, my Lady, are the bearer of a most marvellous destiny—” … … … CHAPTER SE V ENT Y-EIGHT TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING It was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992. Mr and Mrs Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a certain special section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands—though today the cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks, but rather viewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a great white blankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and soldiers. For now it showed only the reflected dull grey colour of the surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the weather-wizards had promised that the rain wouldn’t break before nightfall.) Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere parents were to Stay Out—for much the same reason that impatient children are told to get out of the kitchen and not meddle in the cook’s affairs. The only reason for a parent-teacher conference was if a teacher felt that a parent wasn’t shaping up properly. It took an exceptional circumstance to make the Hogwarts administration feel that it had to justify itself to you. On any given occasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was backed up by eight hundred years of distinguished history and you were not. Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr and Mrs Davis had insisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It was hard to muster a proper sense of indignation when you were confronting the same dignified witch who, twelve years and four months earlier, had given both of you two weeks’ detention after catching you in the act of conceiving Tracey. On the other hand, Mr and Mrs Davis’ courage had been helped by angrily waving about a copy of The Quibbler whose headline showed, in bright bold text for all the world to see: Pacts With Potter? Bones, Davis, Granger In Love Rectangle Of Fear And so Mr and Mrs Davis had argued their way into the Faculty Box of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced with an excellent view of Professor Quirrell’s enchanted screens, so that the two of them could see for themselves “Just what the Fiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school, if you’ll pardon the expression, Deputy Head- mistress McGonagall!” Seated to the left of Mr Davis was another concerned parent, a white- haired man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one Lucius Mal- foy, political leader of the strongest faction of the Wizengamot. To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a scarred face who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson. Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott, rumoured to be nearly as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord Jugson’s left. On the right of Mrs Davis, one would find the comely Lady and yet handsomer Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey silken robes set with tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape of grass blades. The Lady Greengrass was considered a key swing vote on the Wizengamot, her own mother having retired from the body with surprising speed. Her charming husband, though his family was not noble or wealthy of itself, had taken a seat on the Hogwarts Board of Governors. To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old witch, who had shaken hands with Mr and Mrs Davis without the slightest hint of condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. To Amelia’s right was an oldish woman who had set the fashion scene of magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture into her hat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed as Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise the full rights of the Longbottom family for so long as their last scion had yet to attain his majority, and she was con- sidered a prominent figure in a minority faction of the Wizengamot. At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief Warlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, legendary defeater of Grindelwald, protector of Britain, re- discoverer of the fabled twelve uses of dragon’s blood, the most powerful wizard in the world &c. And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic Defence Professor of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning back on the cushioned benches as though resting; seeming entirely and naturally at ease in the rarefied company of a voting quorum of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had dropped by on this fine Saturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had been going on at Hogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular. The name of Harry Potter had also been much discussed. Oh, and one mustn’t forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director Bones’s eyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the young couple introduced as her parents. Lord Jugson had given them a brief, incredu- lous stare before dismissing them with a snort. Lucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his smile containing a hint of grim amusement mixed with pity. Mr and Mrs Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance had been touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who had all of three hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault, and who respec- tively worked at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop and enchanting Om- nioculars, were pressed up tightly against each other, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned benches, and desperately wishing they’d worn nicer robes. The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker and lighter greys, grim with the promise of future storms; though no light- ning flickered as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder echoed; and only a few threatening droplets had fallen. 1242 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1243 CH APTER 78 1244 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon Gen- eral and the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red flame had led them, beneath grey skies. At Draco’s right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command, who had once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned. At Draco’s back was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had served the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the muscular boy was watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle had been declared or no. Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood waiting beside one of the two broomsticks Dragon Army had been given; if the Goyles had not served the Malfoys so long as the Crabbes, yet they had served no less well. And at Draco’s left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of Gryffindor, a mudblood or possible half-blood who knew nothing of his father. Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate move on Harry’s part, Draco was certain. Three other former Chaotics had also been transferred to Dragon Army, and all were watching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant the slightest insult. Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry had also sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even though Professor Quirrell’s mandate had only required that Harry give up one Lieutenant. That too had been a deliberate move, making crystal clear to everyone that Harry wasn’t dumping his least-favoured soldiers. In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the true loy- alties of his new soldiers if they’d thought Harry hadn’t wanted them. In another sense…well, it wasn’t easy to put into words. Harry had given him good soldiers with their pride intact, but it was more than that. Harry had showed kindliness toward his soldiers, but it was more than that. It wasn’t just Harry playing fair, it was something that…that you couldn’t help but contrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House. So Draco hadn’t offered the slightest insult to Mr Thomas, but brought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma but no-one else. It was a test, Draco had told Mr Thomas and everyone, not a pro- motion. Mr Thomas would have to show himself worthy of rank within Dragon Army—but he would be given a chance, and the chance would be fair. Mr Thomas had looked surprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from what Draco had heard, didn’t stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy had stood a little straighter, and nodded. And then, after Mr Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon Army’s training sessions, he’d been brought into the strategy session in Dragon Army’s huge military office. And a few minutes into the ses- sion, Padma had happened to ask—as though it was a perfectly normal question—whether Mr Thomas had any ideas about how to defeat the Chaos Legion. The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted that General Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that, and that Harry had given him the message that General Malfoy should ask himself where his relative advantage lay—what Draco Malfoy could do, or what Dragon Army could do, that the Chaos Legion couldn’t match—and then try to exploit it for all it was worth. Dean Thomas couldn’t think of what that advantage might be, but if he did come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he’d share them. Harry had ordered him to, after all. Sigh, Draco had thought, since he couldn’t actually sigh out loud. But it was good advice, and Draco had followed it, sitting at his bedroom desk with quill and parchment listing out everything that might be a relative advantage. And, almost to Draco’s own surprise, he’d had an idea, a real one. In fact he’d had two. The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding more ominous than ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried “Up!” and leapt onto their broomsticks, heading into the grey sky. 1247 CH APTER 78 1248 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1249 CH APTER 78 Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion—or fifteen plus Blaise Zabini, rather—marched confidently through the forest, their shoes thud- ding over the still-dry ground. Their camouflage uniforms blended into the forest even more than usual, all colours washed out by the tints of an overcast day. Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriors and twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers. The common consensus had been that, with odds that bad, it was prac- tically impossible for them to lose. After all, General Chaos was bound to come up with something really spectacular, facing odds like that. There was something almost nightmarish about how everyone seemed to now expect Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on demand, any time one was needed. It meant that if you couldn’t do the impossible, you were disappointing your friends and failing to live up to your potential… Harry hadn’t bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about ‘too much pressure’. Harry’s mental model of the Defence Professor had pre- dicted him looking severely annoyed, saying things along the lines of You are perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr Potter; did you even try? and then deducting several hundred Quirrell points. From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, the high young voice of Tess Walsh cried “Friend!” and after another moment, “Gingersnap!” A handful of seconds later, the soldier who’d code-named herself Gin- gersnap returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating slightly in the cool but humid air from the jog that had taken her to the oak tree Neville had spotted. Gingersnap approached to where Shannon was hold- ing a uniform-shirt with the neck tied off, in lieu of anyone having to Transfigure a bag. When Gingersnap brought her hands forward to try and dump her acorns into the holding-shirt, Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right, then to the left again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the acorns, until a sharp “Miss Friedman!” from Lieutenant Nott caused Shannon to sigh and hold the shirt still. Ginger- snap dumped her acorns into those accumulated, and then headed out for more. Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very own version of the Chaos Legion’s marching song, and around half the other soldiers were trying to step along with it despite not knowing the tune in advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, who had a high Transfiguration score, finished creating yet another pair of green sunglasses, and handed them to Adam Beringer, who folded up the sunglasses before tucking them into his uniform pocket. Other soldiers were already wearing their own green sunglasses, despite the cloudy day. You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly complicated and fascinating explanation behind this, and you would be right. Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in the comfy rocking chair he’d obtained for his trunk’s cavern level, pondering silently in the quiet span between classes and dinner time, thinking about power. For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and twenty-eight Dragons they would need a force amplifier. There were limits to what you could do with manœuvre. There had to be a secret weapon and it had to be invincible, or at least moderately unstoppable. Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts’s mock battles, banned by Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other clever and un- usual spell was that an army twice your own size could brute-force Finite almost anything you tried. The Sunshine Regiment might have missed that tactic with the Transfigured chain mail, but nobody would miss it again now that Professor Quirrell had pointed it out. And Finite Incantatem was a brute-force counter-spell which required at least as much magic as the spell being cancelled…which, if you were severely outnumbered, made it a whole new order of military challenge. The enemy could Finite anything you tried, and still have enough magic left over for shields and volleys of Sleep Hexes. Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinary strength of first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful for the enemy to Finite. So Harry had asked Neville if he’d ever heard of any small, safe sacrifi- cial rituals— And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided, after Harry had stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and just given up the whole thing as impossible from a public relations stand- point, Harry had realized that he hadn’t even needed to go there. They taught you how to invoke potencies far beyond your own strength in ordinary Hogwarts classes. Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something, you didn’t realize what you were looking at until you happened to ask exactly the right question. Defence. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic. Astronomy. Broomstick Flying. Herbology… “Foe!” screamed the voice from above. 1252 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1253 CH APTER 78 “Report!” snapped the Dragon General, doing his best to conceal the fatigue he felt after casting seventeen Locking Charms, with more yet to come. Beads of sweat now dotted Gregory’s forehead. “The enemy downed Dylan Vaughan,” Gregory said formally. “Harry Potter and Blaise Zabini were each Transfiguring something dark grey and roundish, I don’t think it was finished but it looked like it would be big and hollow, sort of cauldron-shaped. Zabini’s was smaller than Potter’s. I couldn’t get either of them or disrupt their Transfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on a broomstick and he’s still a terrible flyer but his aim is really good.” Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and Dean Thomas, who both shook their own heads, indicating that they also couldn’t think of what might be big and grey and shaped like a cauldron. “Anything else?” said Draco. If that was it, they’d lost a broom for nothing— “The only other weird thing I saw,” Gregory said, sounding puzzled, “was that some Chaotics were wearing…sort of like goggles?” Draco thought about this, not noticing that he’d stopped marching or that all of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with him. “Was there anything special about the goggles?” Draco said. “Um…” Gregory said. “They were…greenish, maybe?” “Okay,” said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking once more and his Dragons followed. “Here’s our new strategy. We’re only go- ing to send eleven Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not fourteen. That should be enough to beat them, now that we can neutralize their special advantage.” It was a gamble, but you had to take gambles sometimes, if you wanted to come in first in a three-way battle. “You figured out Chaos’s plan, General Malfoy?” said Mr Thomas with considerable surprise. “What are they doing?” said Padma. “I haven’t the faintest idea,” said Draco, with a smirk of the most re- fined smugness. “We’ll just do the obvious thing.” 1255 CH APTER 78 1256 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1257 CH APTER 78 1258 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1259 CH APTER 78 1260 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING The vast parchment-like screen now showed only an ærial view of the forest, from which you could barely make out the camouflaged forms of three armies, split up into two groups each, converging to fight their three-way battle. The benches of the Quidditch stadium were now rapidly filling up with the more easily bored sort of spectator who only wanted to be there for the final battle and skip out on all the boring points along the way. (If there was anything wrong with Professor Quirrell’s battles, it was widely agreed, it was that his spectacles didn’t last nearly as long as Quidditch matches, once they actually started. To this Professor Quirrell had replied only, Such is realism, and that had been that.) Within the huge window—it was all one window now, observing from a great height—the vague collections of tiny camouflaged forms grew closer. Closer. Almost touching— 1262 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING One of the Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made a hand-sign, pointing forward and oblique left; and there was a sudden hushed hiss of whispers among the Dragon Army contingent as they all quietly reori- ented themselves in the direction of the enemy. The Sunnies knew they were there, of course both armies knew; but somehow, in this moment, they had all become instinctively quiet. The Dragons crept forward further, and then further, the dull camou- flaged forms of the Sunnies beginning to appear among the distant trees, and still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed the call to charge. Draco was now at the forefront of his soldiers, Vincent behind him and Padma only a shade further back; if the three of them could take the shock of Sunshine’s best, the rest of Dragon Army might stand a chance. Then Draco saw one Sunnie staring at him from the distance, in the vanguard of her own army; staring at him with a look of fury— Across the forest battleground, their eyes met. Draco had only a fraction of a second to wonder, in the back of his mind, what Hermione Granger was so angry about, before the shout went up from both their armies; and they were all running forward to the charge. 1263 CH APTER 78 1264 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING “We’ll both take him at once,” Daphne whispered. She knew that a few fear-filled minutes of real combat experience, a handful of times each week, might not be enough to match Neville’s regular duelling practice with Harry and Cedric Diggory over the same period. “He’s too much for one of us, but both of us together—I’ll use my Charm, you just try to stun him—” Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the top of their lungs and charged forward, the Hover Charms of two supporting Sunshine Soldiers moving them faster and making them light on their feet, Daphne already crying “Tonare!” even as Hannah kept a huge Contego shield moving in front of them, and with a brief extra lift they leapt over the heads of the front screen of soldiers and landed in front of Neville with their hair billowing high around them— (Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, but somehow this moment still ended up on the front page of the next day’s Quibbler.) —and in the same instant, because fighting older bullies had burned away the slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her first Sleep Hex at Neville (she’d started the incantation while she was still in the air) even as Daphne, concentrating more on speed than on force, slashed down with her Ancient Blade at where she thought Neville’s thighs would be after he dodged— But Neville leapt up, not sideways, leapt up higher than he should’ve been able to go, so that her glowing sword cut only the air beneath his feet. Somehow Daphne realized what it meant, that Neville still had other Chaotics Hovering him, in time for her to raise her Blade up over her head, but Neville fell too fast and when his Blade smashed into hers it was like being hit by a Bludger. It knocked Daphne off her feet and sent her sprawling backward onto the grass, hitting the ground hard on her back. It might have been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn’t landed too hard himself and gone to his knees with a pained gasp. And then before Neville could bring his glowing Blade down, Hannah shouted “Somnium!” and Neville lurched frantically backward—though of course no spell had ac- tually come from Hannah’s wand, the Hufflepuff girl couldn’t really have fired again that fast—which gave Daphne a second to scramble to her feet and get both hands around her wand again— “Expelliarmus!” shouted Draco, trying not to let his voice crack as he simultaneously dodged the blazing red stun bolt that Hermione Granger had fired at him, his muscles twisting with the need to dodge in the wrong direction—she’d pointed to his left, and then with a mysterious twitch fired right— Hermione dodged the fast-moving duelling hex, and cried with hardly another moment’s pause, “Steleus!”, a wide-angle Hex that Draco couldn’t avoid, but he managed to point his wand at his own face and cry “Quies- cus!” before the sudden urge to inhale could devolve into a sneezing fit that would’ve ended the battle. Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the Locking Charms and Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was beginning to give way to a sense of his own blood boiling, he didn’t know why Granger was attacking him so angrily all of a sudden, but if she wanted a fight he’d give her one— (The Dragons and Sunnies weren’t stopping to watch the duel of their Generals, the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch and that meant the Sunnies had to go on fighting too; but the gaping audience in the Hogwarts Quidditch stands were being distracted even from Neville and Daphne’s spectacle, shifting their eyes to the duel of two Generals as Malfoy and Granger fired hex after hex and jinx after jinx at each other, casting more rapidly than any other student in their year could have man- aged, the Dragon General’s trained duelling dance matched by the Sun- shine General’s frantic energy, the combat between them beginning to resemble an adult duel as the two most magically powerful first-years re- sorted to spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.) —although, Draco was beginning to realize, when he and Harry and Professor Quirrell had dismissed Miss Granger as having as much intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes, they’d never seen her angry. 1267 CH APTER 78 “Today Mr Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his feel- ings of pity and remorse,” said Professor Quirrell. “And chivalry,” said Amelia, sipping her tea again. 1268 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1269 CH APTER 78 1270 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING “Now!” bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now command- ing a detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. “I mean, Tunafish!” The Slythe- rin boy’s hand grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron from the trigger- ing touch of daylight, already beginning to move it aside. “Now!” bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding a consignment of Dragon Warriors. “Do whatever they do!” The Chaotics of Zabini’s detachment plunged their hands into their uniform pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses— —an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon War- riors, who drew forth green-coloured Potions goggles, and quickly drew the straps over their own heads, even as the Chaotics put on their sun- glasses and the violet incandescence blasted forth. (As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr Goyle reported that the Chaos Legion was wearing green-coloured Potions goggles, you didn’t have to know why to Transfigure some copies.) “THAT’S CHEATING!” shrieked Blaise Zabini. “THAT’S TECHNIQUE!” Dean yelled back. “DRAGONS, CHARGE!” (“Pardon me,” the Lady Greengrass said. “Could you stop laughing like that, Mr Quirrell? It’s unnerving.”) “Finite their goggles!” shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armies ran headlong toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing purple glare. “We can still win!” “You heard him!” bellowed Dean. “Get their glasses!” Blaise Zabini’s reply to this wasn’t anything articulate. That battle went on a lot longer. 1271 CH APTER 78 1272 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING Mr and Mrs Davis were shaking as they stood up from the comfortable chairs of the faculty Quidditch box; they couldn’t quite clutch each other while walking, but they held hands tightly, pretending hard to be invisible. If they’d been children young enough for accidental magic they probably would’ve spontaneously Disillusioned themselves. The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his chair. The scarred Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his own chair. Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood. All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the stairwell of the elevated stands, moving in eerie unison like an Auror trio— “Lord Malfoy,” the Defence Professor said in mild tones. That man was still seated in his own chair, looking upon his parchment-like screens, arms limp at his side, as though for some reason he didn’t feel like mov- ing. The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit archway, and the elderly man and the scarred man halted as well, flanking him. Lord Malfoy’s head turned, too slightly to be any form of acknowledge- ment, but in the Defence Professor’s direction. “Your son performed exceptionally well today,” said Professor Quirrell. “I must confess that I underestimated him. And he has earned his army’s loyalty, as you have witnessed.” Still very mild, the Defence Professor’s voice. “Speaking as your son’s teacher, it is my opinion that he will not benefit if you interfere in his—” Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs. “A fine try, Quirinus,” Dumbledore said quietly. The old wizard’s face showed small lines of worry; he hadn’t risen from his own seat either, star- ing at the parchment screens as though they were still active. “Do you think he will listen?” The Defence Professor’s shoulders twitched in a slight shrug, the only movement they’d shown since the battle ended. “Well,” said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and cracked her knuck- les, stretching, her husband silent beside her. “I must say, that was quite… interesting…” Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without any fuss. “Interesting indeed,” said Director Bones. “I do confess, I find myself dis- turbed by the skill with which those children were fighting one another.” “The skill?” Lord Greengrass said. “Their spells didn’t seem all that im- pressive to me. Except for Daphne’s, of course.” The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at the Defence Professor’s balding head. “The Stunning Hex is not a first- year spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had in mind. They supported each other with those simple spells, they reacted at speed to surprises…” The Director of the DMLE paused, as though searching for words that a mere civilian could understand. “In the midst of battle,” she said finally, “with spells flying in every direction…those children seemed quite at home.” “Indeed, Director Bones,” said the Defence Professor. “Some arts are best begun in youth.” The old witch’s eyes narrowed. “You are readying them to become a military force, Professor. To what end?” “Now hold on!” interjected Lord Greengrass. “There’s plenty of schools where they teach duelling in first year!” “Duelling?” said the Defence Professor. From behind it wasn’t visible if the pale face was smiling. “That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combat con- ditions change and change again. They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued. They have learned that to survive they must follow or- ders. Some have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, these wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they know how to fight.” Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three times. 1275 CH APTER 78 1276 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1277 CH APTER 78 1278 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1279 CH APTER 78 1280 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING That night at dinner time, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and told him that she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his plot against Hermione very soon. She was warning all the members of sphew, and she’d warned Professor Sprout, and she’d warned Professor Flitwick, and she was going to send a letter to her Aunt tonight, and now she was warn- ing Harry Potter, too. Only they couldn’t quite talk about it with Padma— Susan said, looking very serious—because Padma was feeling torn be- tween her loyalty to Hermione and her loyalty to her General. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feeling more frustrated with the entire situation than anything really productive, snapped at her that yes, he knew something had to be done. After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of the Ravenclaw table, where Hermione had sat down away from him or Padma or Anthony or any of her other friends. But Hermione didn’t look like she was in a mood where somebody go- ing over and bothering her would be taken very well. Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and fan- tasy novels, people always made their big, important choices for big, im- portant reasons. Hari Seldon had created his Foundation to rebuild the ashes of the Galactic Empire, not because he would look more important if he could be in charge of his own research group. Raistlin Majere had sev- ered ties with his brother because he wanted to become a god, not because he was incompetent at personal relationships and unwilling to ask for ad- vice on how to do better. Frodo Baggins had taken the Ring because he was a hero who wanted to save Middle-Earth, not because it would’ve been too awkward not to. If anyone ever wrote a true history of the world—not that anyone ever could or would—probably 97% of all the key moments of Fate would turn out to be constructed of lies and tissue paper and trivial little thoughts that somebody could’ve just as easily thought differently. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger, where she’d sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a sense of reluctance to bother her when she looked like she was already in a bad mood. So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk to Draco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively definitely assure Hermione that Draco really wasn’t plotting against her. And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin basement and was told by Vincent that the boss ain’t to be disturbed…then Harry thought that maybe he should see if Hermione would talk to him right away. That he should just get started on unravelling the whole mess before it ravelled any further. Harry wondered if he might just be procras- tinating, if his mind had just found a clever excuse to put off something unenjoyable-but-necessary. He actually thought that. And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he’d just talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, and then talk to Hermione. Human beings did that sort of thing all the time. 1282 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1283 CH APTER 78 1284 TABOO TRADE-OFFS PRELUDE: CHEATING 1285 1287 CH APTER 79 Minerva couldn’t possibly have stood still, she paced back and forth through the Headmaster’s office, the back of her mind half-expecting Se- verus or Harry to tell her to shut up and sit down, but neither the Potions Master or the Boy-Who-Lived seemed much concerned with her, both of their gazes focused on Albus Dumbledore where he had emerged from the Floo. There were sounds in the background that nobody heard. Se- verus seemed as passionless as ever, sitting in a small cushioned chair beside the Headmaster’s desk. The old wizard stood terrible and upright by the still-burning fireplace, robed in black like a starless night, radiat- ing power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter confusion and horror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his fingers gripping the seat, and his eyes were fury and freezing ice. At 6:33 a.m., Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo’s from his of- fice for immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had found Mr Malfoy in the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of death from the continuing effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly lowering his body temperature. Professor Quirrell had immediately dispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr Malfoy, and levitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo’s for further treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the Headmaster, stating the facts briefly before vanishing through the Floo; the Aurors, notified by St. Mungo’s, had demanded his presence for questioning. The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill Draco Malfoy so slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect sudden injury, would not trigger. Under interrogation, Professor Quirrell had told the Aurors that he had cast several tracking Charms upon Mr Malfoy’s per- son in January, shortly after Mr Malfoy’s return to Hogwarts from the Christmas holidays. Professor Quirrell had cast tracking Charms because he had learned of a person with a motive to harm Mr Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had refused to identify this person. The tracking Charms which Professor Quirrell had cast were triggered by Mr Malfoy’s health falling be- low an absolute level, rather than by sudden changes, and had therefore alerted Professor Quirrell before Mr Malfoy had died. Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr Malfoy from with- holding any meliorating or moderating information in his statements, had shown that Mr Malfoy had—legally under the laws of Noble Houses, illegally under the regulations of Hogwarts—challenged Hermione Gran- ger to a duel. Mr Malfoy had won the duel but had then, as he left, been attacked from behind by Miss Granger with a Stunning Hex. After this Mr Malfoy knew nothing. Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all relevant information, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that she had stunned Draco Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of anger, cast the Blood-Cooling Charm on him, with the deliberate intention of killing him slowly enough to evade identification from the Hogwarts wards, whose workings she had read about in Hogwarts: A History. She had been horrified at herself upon awakening the next morning, but had not told anyone of what she’d done, believing Draco Malfoy to be already dead— as he certainly would have been after seven hours, had his body’s own magic not been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm. “Her trial,” said Albus Dumbledore, “is set for tomorrow at noon.” “What?” the word burst out of Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his fingers whiten where they gripped the wooden seat beneath him. “That’s insane! You can’t do a police investigation in one day—” The Potions Master raised his voice. “This is not Muggle Britain, Mr Pot- ter!” Severus’s face was as expressionless as ever, but the bite in his voice was sharp. “The Aurors have an accusation under Veritaserum and a con- fession under Veritaserum. So far as they are concerned, the investigation is done.” “Not quite,” said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to explode. “I have insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the utmost scrutiny. Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at midnight—” “Supposed duel,” Harry said sharply. “As the supposed duel was at midnight—yes, you’re quite right, Harry— it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner—” “Also supposedly,” the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. “And rather sus- piciously, since the alleged murder suspect doesn’t know about Time- Turners. I hope that an invisible Auror was immediately sent back in time as far as possible to observe—” Dumbledore inclined his head. “I went myself, Harry, the moment I heard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr Malfoy was already unconscious and Miss Granger had gone—” “No,” said Harry Potter. “You reached the trophy room and saw Draco unconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did not observe Hermione there, or watch her leave. Let us distinguish observation from inference.” The boy’s head turned to look at her. “Imperius, Obliviation, False Memory Charm, Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leaving out any mind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this or make her believe she’d done it?” “The Confundus Charm,” she said. And the Dark Arts had never been her study, but she knew—“And certain Dark rituals. But none of those could be performed in Hogwarts without alarm.” The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. “Which of those spells can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to detect?” “The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours,” she said, af- ter a moment to gather her thoughts. “Miss Granger would remember the Imperius. Obliviation cannot be detected by any known means, but only a Professor could have cast that spell upon a student without alarm from the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency—can only be detected by another Legilimens, I think—” “I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court Legilimens,” said Dumbledore. “The examination showed—” “Do we trust him?” said Harry. “Her,” said Dumbledore. “Sophie McJorgenson, whom I remember as an honest student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the Unbreakable Vow to tell the truth of what she sees—” “Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?” Harry Potter interrupted again. “What did you observe, Headmaster?” Albus said heavily, “A person who looked like Madam McJorgenson told us that a single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger’s mind some months ago. That is from January, Harry, when I communicated with Miss Granger about the matter of a certain Dementor. That was ex- pected; but what I did not expect was the rest of what Sophie found.” The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo-fire, letting the orange flames re- flect on his face. “As you say, Harry, a False Memory Charm is one possibil- ity; they are, when cast perfectly, indistinguishable from true memory—” “That doesn’t surprise me,” Harry interrupted. “Studies show that human memories are more or less rewritten every time we remember them—” “Harry,” Minerva said softly, and the boy’s mouth clamped shut. The old wizard continued. “—but a False Memory Charm of such qual- ity requires as much time to create as a true memory. Creating a detailed memory of ten minutes would be ten minutes’ work. And according to the court Legilimens,” Albus’s face now seemed more tired and lined than be- fore, “Miss Granger has been obsessing over Mr Malfoy since the day that Severus…yelled at her. She has been thinking of how Mr Malfoy might be in league with Professor Snape, how he might be planning to harm her and harm Harry—imagining it for hours every day—it would be impossi- ble to create false memories for so much time.” “The appearance of insanity…” Severus murmured softly, as though he were speaking to himself. “Could it be natural? No, it is too disastrous to be pure accident; too convenient for someone, I have no doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But that would not be enough—Miss Granger’s madness would have to be guided—” “Ah!” Harry said suddenly. “I get it now. The first False Memory Charm was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape yelled at her, and showed, say, Draco and Professor Snape plotting to kill her. Then last night that False Memory was removed by Obliviation, leaving behind the memories of her obsessing about Draco for no apparent reason, at the same time she and Draco were given false memories of the duel.” Minerva blinked in astonishment. It would have been a thousand years before she thought of that possibility. The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. “The reac- tion to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in advance, Mr Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects do not always act as expected, when they first remember the false memories. It would have been a risky ploy. But I suppose that is one way Professor Quirrell could have done it.” “Professor Quirrell?” said Harry. “What motive does he have to—” The Potions Master said dryly, “The Defence Professor is always a sus- pect, Mr Potter. You will notice a trend, given time.” Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all turned to look at him. “But in this case there is another suspect,” Albus said qui- etly. “Voldemort.” That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the room, cancelling all the heat from the orange flames of the fireplace. “I do not know,” the old wizard said slowly, “I know all too little of the methods of Voldemort’s immortality. He searched out those books before I did, I think. All I could find were ancient tales, scattered across too many volumes for him to remove. But to find truth among many stories is also a wizard’s mastery, and this I have endeavoured to do. There is a human sacrifice, a murder, of that I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in horror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing mad deeds, claiming the names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there is usually a device, of that Dark Lord, which they wield…” Albus looked at Harry, the ancient eyes searching the younger. “I think, Harry—though you will call it only inference—that the act of murder splits the soul. That by ritual of blackest horror, the torn fragment of soul is chained to this world. To a material thing of this world. Which must be, or which then becomes, a device of power.” Horcrux. The terrible name echoed in Minerva’s mind, though it seemed that—for what reason she did not know—Albus would not speak that word in front of Harry. “And therefore,” the old wizard finished quietly, “the remainder of the soul is bound to its chained part, lingering here when its body is destroyed. A sad and painful existence, I think it would be; less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost…” The old wizard’s eyes were locked on Harry, who gazed back with his eyes narrowed. “It would take time for that mutilated soul to regain a mockery of life. That is why we have had our ten-year reprieve, I believe; why Voldemort did not return at once. But in time…that revenant would become capable of rising again.” The old wizard spoke with grim precision. “It is clear, from the stories, that the Dark Lords who return by possessing another’s form, wield lesser magics than they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would be satisfied with that. He would take some other avenue to life. But Voldemort was more Slytherin than Salazar, grasping at every opportunity. He would use his pitiful state, use his power of possession, if he had reason. If he could benefit by another’s…inexplicable fury.” Albus’s voice had fallen to almost a whisper. “That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger.” Minerva’s throat was very dry. “He’s here,” she gasped. “Here, in Hog- warts—” And stopped, because the reason Voldemort had come to Hogwarts— The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in that whis- per, “I am sorry, Minerva, you were right.” Harry’s voice was edged. “Right about what?” “Voldemort’s strongest avenue to life,” Dumbledore said heavily. “The most desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater and more terrible than ever before. It is guarded here, within this castle—” “Excuse me,” Harry said politely. “Are you stupid?” “Harry,” she said, but there was no force in her voice. “I mean, maybe you haven’t noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore, but this castle is full of children—” “I had no choice!” bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes were blazing now, beneath the half-moon spectacles. “I do not own it, that thing which Voldemort desires. It belongs to another, and is held here by his consent! I asked if it could be kept in the Department of Mysteries. But he would not permit that—he said it must be within the wards of Hogwarts, in the place of the Founders’ protection—” Dumbledore passed his hand across his forehead. “No,” the old wizard said in a quieter voice. “I cannot pass this blame to him. He is right. There is too much power in that thing, too much that men desire. I agreed that the trap should be laid behind the wards of Hogwarts, in the place of my own power.” The old wizard bowed his head. “I knew Voldemort would worm his way here somehow, and planned to trap him. I did not think—I did not dream—that he would tarry in an enemy fortress one minute longer than he must.” “But,” said Severus in some puzzlement, “what would the Dark Lord possibly gain by killing Lucius’s only heir?” “Point of order,” Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice. “The mo- tives of whoever’s behind this are not the primary issue. Our top priority at this point is that an innocent Hogwarts student is in trouble!” The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed back at the Boy-Who-Lived— “Quite right, Mr Potter,” Minerva said, she hadn’t even thought about it, the words just seemed to pop out of her lips. “Albus, who is watching over Miss Granger now?” “Professor Flitwick has gone to her,” the Headmaster said. “She needs a lawyer,” Harry said. “Anyone who just blurts out ‘I did it’ to the police—” “Unfortunately,” Minerva said, her tone taking on some of Professor Dumbledore’s sternness without thinking, “I doubt an attorney will be any use to Miss Granger at this point, Mr Potter. She is to face the judge- ment of the Wizengamot, and they would be exceedingly unlikely to free her on a technicality.” Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression, as though suggesting that Hermione Granger didn’t need an attorney was akin to suggesting that she be set on fire. “She is correct, Mr Potter,” Severus said quietly. “Few court processes in this country involve solicitors.” Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. “Fine. How do we get Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it’s too much to hope that with all the lawyers gone, the judges understand the concept of ‘common sense’ and ‘prior probability’ well enough to realize that twelve-year-old girls basically never commit cold-blooded murders?” “It is the Wizengamot that she faces,” said Severus. “The oldest Noble Houses, and certain other wizards of influence.” Severus’s face twisted in something approaching his customary sarcasm. “As for them showing common sense—you might as well expect them to make you a bacon sand- wich, Potter.” Harry nodded, his mouth set. “Exactly what sort of penalty is Hermi- one facing? Snapped wand and expulsion—” “No,” Severus said. “Nothing that light. Are you wilfully misunder- standing, Potter? She is facing the Wizengamot. There is no set penalty. There is only the vote.” Harry Potter murmured, “The rule of law, in complex times, has proved itself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it’s vastly more efficient… There’s no constraining legal rules at all, then?” Light glinted off the old wizard’s half-moon glasses; he spoke care- fully, and not without anger. “Legally, Harry, we are dealing with a blood debt from Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The Lord of Malfoy proposes a repayment of that debt, and then the Wizengamot votes on his proposal. That is all.” “But…” Harry said slowly. “Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin, he’s got to realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the one he should actually be angry at. Right?” “No, Harry Potter,” Albus Dumbledore said heavily. “That is how you wish Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy himself…will not share your desire that he think that way.” Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the same time that Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own emotions, stop her pacing and try to breathe. She’d been trying not to think about it, trying to turn her thoughts away from it, but she knew. She’d known since the instant she’d heard. She could see it in Albus’s eyes— “Is she facing capital punishment?” Harry said quietly, and chills went all the way down Minerva’s spine at the undertones of that voice. “No!” Albus said. “No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a first-year in Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet.” “But Lucius Malfoy,” Severus said tonelessly, “certainly will not be sat- isfied with only snapping her wand.” “All right,” Harry said commandingly. “As I see it, we’ve got two essen- tial lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit. Line two, other leverage over Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved Draco’s life, does that create a blood debt from House Malfoy to him that he could redeem to cancel Hermi- one’s?” Minerva blinked in astonishment again. “No,” Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. “It was a clever thought—but no, Harry, I’m afraid not. There is an exception when the Wizengamot suspects that the circumstances of a life-debt may have been created deliberately. And the Defence Professor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue.” Harry nodded once, face set. “Headmaster, I know I said I wouldn’t— but under the circumstances—that time Draco cast that torture hex on me, is that debt enough—” “No,” the old wizard said (even as she blurted “What?” and Severus lifted an eyebrow). “It would not have been enough, and now it is no debt at all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify under Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy could be Obliviated of his own memory before he could testify—” Albus hesitated. “Harry…whatever you have done with Draco, you must assume that Lucius Malfoy will soon know of it.” Harry’s head sank into his hands. “He’ll give Draco Veritaserum.” “Yes,” Albus said quietly. The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything, as he sat with his head in his hands. The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. “Draco really was trying to help Miss Granger,” Severus said. “You—Potter, you actually—” “Turned him?” Harry said from between his hands. “I was about three- quarters done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything. I don’t know what will happen now, though.” “Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day,” Albus said. The sound of old wizard’s voice was like the look of the boy with his head in his hands. “He has taken two of our pieces, with one…No. I should have seen it earlier. He has taken two of Harry’s pieces with one move. Volde- mort has begun his game again, not against myself, but against Harry. Voldemort knows the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He is not waiting to face Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry’s side when they are grown. He is striking at them now.” “Maybe it’s You-Know-Who and maybe it isn’t,” Harry said, his voice sounding a little unsteady. “Let’s not narrow down the hypothesis space prematurely.” Harry took a breath and lowered his hands. “The other thing we can try is to nail the real culprit before the trial—or at least find solid evidence that someone else did it.” “Mr Potter,” said Minerva, “Professor Quirrell told the Aurors that he knew of someone with a motive to harm Mr Malfoy. Do you know who he was talking about?” “Yes,” Harry said, after a hesitation. “But I think I shall conduct that part of my investigation with the Defence Professor—just as I would not have Professor Quirrell in the room while we were discussing how to in- vestigate him.” “He suspects me?” Severus said, then gave a short laugh. “Why, of course he does.” “My own plan,” said Harry, “is to go and look at the trophy room where the supposed duel took place and see if I can discover anything anomalous. If you can tell the investigating Aurors to let me through—” “What investigating Aurors?” Severus said tonelessly. Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then spoke again. “In mystery books it usually takes longer than one day to solve a crime, but twenty-four hours is—no, thirty hours is eighteen hundred minutes. And I can think of at least one other important place to look for clues— though it’ll have to be someone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm. Back when Hermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under her pillow each morning, telling her where to go—” “Albus…” ground out Minerva. “I did not send them,” said the old wizard. His white eyebrows had lifted in surprise. “I knew nothing of this. You think she was being played, Harry?” “It’s a possibility,” Harry said. “More so, because there’s a part of this puzzle that you don’t know about yet.” Harry’s voice lowered, grew more intense. “Headmaster, you already know that I got my father’s invisibility cloak from someone who left a note under my pillow, saying it was an early Christmas present. I think we have to assume that’s the same person who left notes for Hermione—” “Harry,” the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily. “Returning your father’s cloak to you, does not seem to me like the act of a villain—” “Listen,” Harry Potter said urgently. “The part you don’t know is that af- ter Bellatrix Black escaped from Azkaban, I found another note under my pillow, signed ‘Santa Claus’, saying that they’d heard you were shutting me up inside Hogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route to the Salem Witches’ Institute in America. That note came with a deck of cards, in which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey—” “Mr Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn’t even thought be- fore she spoke. “That could well be a kidnapping attempt! You should have told—” “Yes, Professor, I did the sensible thing,” the boy said levelly. “As adapted to the circumstances, I did the sensible thing. I told Professor Quir- rell. And according to Professor Quirrell, that portkey goes to somewhere in London—it’s definitely not strong enough to be an international portkey. Now it’s possible that the person who sent the note is honest, and that the point in London is just a way station.” The boy reached into his robes and took out a deck of cards, along with a folded paper note. “I will trust you not to go in guns blazing—I mean wands blazing—just in case the sender is an ally of mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I say we spring it now. And whoever it is, take them alive so we can exhibit them before the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that part.” Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved toward Harry. “I’ll need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr Potter—” “Let us not be hasty!” said Albus. “We have not yet examined the notes sent to Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all. Severus, would you enter her dorm and see if you can find those?” Harry Potter’s eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer the Po- tions Master better access to his unruly hair. “You think two different peo- ple are running around Hogwarts leaving notes beneath pillows?” Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward and plucked a hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk. “Quite possibly. If I have learned anything in my tenure as Head of Slytherin, I have learned what ridiculous messes arise when there is more than one plotter and more than one plan. But Headmaster—I think Mr Potter is correct that I should follow this portkey and see where it leads.” Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. “I will speak to you be- fore you go, then.” 1299 CH APTER 79 The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a hundred small fires where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so that if you were to ask for one word describing what the room looked like, the answer would be ‘smoke’. (Assuming you bothered to look at anything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If your gaze could pierce those dank mists, you would see a tiny, cluttered room in which forty stuffed arm- chairs, most of them unused, were crammed around a small open space in the centre of the room, where a circular trapdoor waited on your escape. “The grim!” Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as she peered into George Weasley’s teacup. “The grim! It is a sign of death! One whom you know, George—someone you know is to die! And soon—yes, it shall be quite soon, I think—unless of course it is later—” It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George, if she hadn’t said the same thing to every single other student in their Div- ination class. They were hardly even thinking about it at this point; all their thoughts were on today’s disaster— The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused Professor Trelawney to shriek and spill George’s tea all over his robes, and then an instant later Dumbledore was whooshing up out of the floor with a bird of fire upon his shoulder. “Fred!” the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the black of a moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds. “George! With me, now!” There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George were climbing down the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire class was already speculating what role they’d played in the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy. The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all nearby sounds muted and the old wizard spun on them and held out a hand and commanded, “Give me the map!” “M-map?” said Fred or George in total shock. They’d never even suspected that Dumbledore suspected. “Why, w-we don’t know what you’re—” “Hermione Granger is in trouble,” said the old wizard. “The Map is in our dorm,” George or Fred said immediately. “Just give us a few minutes to get it and we’ll—” The wizard’s arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows, there was a piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of them were in the third-year Gryffindor boys’ dorm. A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Map to the Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving their precious piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person who actually owned it, and the old wizard was frowning at the apparent blankness. “You’ve got to say,” they explained, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good—” “I decline to lie,” said the old wizard. He held the Map high and bel- lowed, “Hear me, Hogwarts! Deligitor prodi!” An instant later the Headmas- ter was wearing the Sorting Hat, which looked scarily right upon his head, as though Dumbledore had always been waiting for a patchwork pointed hat to complete his existence. (Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case it would work for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying to think of pranks that would involve the Sorting Hat.) The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the Sorting Hat off his head and turning it upside-down—it was hard to tell with the Hat upside-down, but it looked a bit cross at the treatment—and then plunged in his hand and drew out a crystal rod. With this instrument he began tracing rune-like patterns on the Map, muttering strange incan- tations that sounded not quite like Latin and echoed in their ears in an unusually creepy fashion. In the midst of tracing one rune he looked up at both of them, fixing them with a sharp glare. “I will return this to you later, sons of Weasley. Go back to class.” “Yes, Headmaster,” they said, and hesitated. “Ah—about Hermione Granger, is she really going to be bound to serve Draco Malfoy forever as his—” “Go,” said the old wizard. They went. When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at the map, which had now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the Gryffin- dor dorms in which they stood, the small handwritten Albus P.W.B. Dum- bledore the only name left therein. The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered, “Find Tom Riddle.” 1303 CH APTER 79 The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls’ dorm, the first-year dorm, a festive place where bronze and blue competed to be the colour of stuffed animals, scarves and dresses, small bits of inexpensive jewellery, and posters of famous people. Hermione Granger’s bed was easy to identify; it was the one that had been attacked by a book monster. Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a number of spells verified this. The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger’s pillow, and beneath her bed, and then began going through her trunk, sort- ing through mentionable and unmentionable items without change of expression, and finally succeeded in drawing forth a set of papers de- scribing places and times where bullies would be found, all of the papers signed only with an elaborate ‘S’. A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the Potions Master left to report the failure of his mission. Padma stared down at her plate. “Hermione wouldn’t just do that!” yelled Mandy Stockbroker, who was practically in tears, in fact she was in tears, her voice would have been loud enough to silence the Great Hall if it hadn’t been for all the other students also screaming at each other. “I—I bet Malfoy tried to—to do things to her—” “Our General would never do that!” Kevin Entwhistle yelled even louder than Mandy. “Of course he would!” shouted Anthony Goldstein. “Malfoy’s the son of a Death Eater!” Padma stared down at her plate. Draco was the General of her army. Hermione was the founder of sphew. Draco had trusted her to be his second-in-command. Hermione was her fellow Ravenclaw. Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she had. Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat hadn’t offered her Hufflepuff. If she’d been Sorted into Hufflepuff it would prob- ably have been much more painful, trying to decide where her divided loyalties lay… She blinked and realized that her vision had blurred again, and raised a trembling hand to wipe once more at her eyes. Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the pan- demonium of lunch, and said in a loud voice, “I bet Granger cheated in her battle yesterday, I bet that’s why Malfoy challenged her—” “All of you shut up!” roared Harry Potter, as he hit the table with his fists so hard that plates rattled all the way along it. At any other time that would have earned him a Professorial repri- mand; this time it just got a few nearby students to look. “I’d wanted to eat lunch,” Harry Potter said, “and then get back to in- vestigating, so I wasn’t going to talk. But you’re all being silly, and when the truth comes out you’re going to regret what you said about innocent people. Draco didn’t do anything, Hermione didn’t do anything, they were both False-Memory-Charmed!” Harry Potter’s voice had been rising on the last words. “How is that not BLOODY OBVIOUS?” “You think we’ll believe that?” Kevin Entwhistle yelled right back at him. “That’s what everyone says! ‘I didn’t do it, it was all just a False Memory Charm!’ You think we’re stupid?” And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending look. The look that came over Harry Potter’s face then made Padma flinch. “I see,” Harry Potter said; it wasn’t a shout, so Padma had to strain to hear it. “Professor Quirrell isn’t here to explain to me how stupid people are, but I bet this time I can get it on my own. People do something dumb and get caught and are given Veritaserum. Not romantic master criminals, because they wouldn’t get caught, they would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic, incompetent criminals get caught, and con- fess under Veritaserum, and they’re desperate to stay out of Azkaban so they say they were False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic criminals with unbelievable excuses. You don’t have to consider the specific details, your brain just pattern-matches the hypothesis into a bucket of things you don’t believe, and you’re done. Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses could never be believed, because he’d heard so many stupid people talking about magic. Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory Charms is low-status.” “What are you blithering about?” said Morag, looking down her nose at the Boy-Who-Lived. “You think we’d believe anything you say?” yelled a slightly older- looking Ravenclaw witch who Padma didn’t recognize. “When you turned Granger Dark?” “And I’m not going to complain,” Harry Potter said in an eerily calm voice, “about wizards not having any logic and believing the craziest things. Because I said that to Professor Quirrell once, and he just gave me this look and said that if I wasn’t blinded by my upbringing I could think of a hundred more ridiculous things that lots of Muggles believe. What you’re all doing is very human and very normal and doesn’t make you unusually bad people, so I’m not going to complain.” The Boy-Who- Lived rose up from his bench. “I’ll see you all later.” And Harry Potter walked away from them, walked away from all of them. “You’re not thinking he’s right, are you?” said Su Li from beside her, in a tone which made it clear what she thought. “I—” said Padma. Her words seemed to be caught in her throat, her thoughts seemed to be caught in her head. “I—I mean—I—” 1308 TABOO TRADE-OFFS I 1309 1311 CH APTER 80 1312 TABOO TRADE-OFFS II: THE HORNS EFFECT 1313 CH APTER 80 Harry gazed unseeing around the hall of the Wizengamot; it looked quite old and historic and there was no doubt that Hermione could have lectured him about the place for hours on end. The plum-coloured robes had stopped arriving, and Harry’s pocket watch, advancing at the rate of three minutes every half-hour, said that the trial was almost due to start. Professor McGonagall was sitting beside him, and her eyes never left him for more than twenty consecutive seconds. Harry had read the Daily Prophet that morning. The headline had been “Mad Muggle-born Tries To End Ancient Line” and the rest of the paper had been the same. When Harry was nine years old the IRA had blown up a British barracks, and he’d watched on TV as all the politicians contested to see who could be the most loudly outraged. And the thought had occurred to Harry—even then, before he’d known much about psychology—that it looked like everyone was competing to see who could be most angry, and nobody would’ve been allowed to suggest that anyone was being too angry, even if they’d just proposed the saturation nuclear bombing of Ireland. He’d been struck, even then, by an essential emptiness in the indignation of politicians—though he hadn’t had the words to describe it, at that age—a sense that they were trying to score cheap points by hitting at the same safe target as everyone else. Harry had always possessed that sense of hollowness about political indignation, but it was strange how very much more obvious it seemed, when you were reading a dozen articles in the Daily Prophet attacking Her- mione Granger. The leading article, written by some name that Harry didn’t recog- nize, had called for the minimum age for Azkaban to be lowered, just so that the twisted mudblood who had defaced the honour of Scotland with her savage, unprovoked attack upon the last heir of a Most Ancient House within the sacred refuge of Hogwarts could be sent to the Demen- tors that were the only punishment commensurate with the severity of her unspeakable crime. Only this would be enough to discourage any other foreign, subhuman brutes who similarly believed in their twisted insanity that they could evade the majesty of the Wizengamot’s inevitable and merciless scourging of all that threatened the honourable nobility of etcetera etcetera etcetera. The next article had said the same thing in less eloquent words. Earlier, Albus Dumbledore had told him, “I will not try to keep you from this trial.” The old wizard’s voice quiet and un- yielding. “I can well foresee how that would go. But I would have you treat me with equal courtesy in return. The politics of the Wizengamot are delicate, and of them you know nothing. Dare any folly and it shall be to Hermione Granger’s cost; and you will remember that folly for the rest of your days, Harry James Potter-Evans- Verres.” “I understand,” Harry said. “I know. Just—if you’re planning to pull a rab- bit out of your hat and save the day at the last minute when everything seems lost, please tell me now instead of letting me sit and worry—” “I would not do that to you,” the old wizard said, a terrible weariness seeming to suffuse him as he turned to go. “Still less to Hermione. But I have no rabbits in my hat, Harry. We can only see what Lucius Malfoy wants.” There was a small sharp rap, a single brief sound that somehow si- lenced the entire room and caused Harry’s head to jerk around and up- ward. High above, Dumbledore had just tapped his podium with the dark rod he held in his left hand. “The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot is convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy,” the old wizard said tonelessly. At once, far to the side of the podium but also in the highest circle, rose a tall man with a mane of long white spilling down from his head over the shoulders of his plum-coloured robes. “I present a witness for questioning under Veritaserum,” Lucius Malfoy said, his cool tone clear throughout the room, smoothly controlled with only a slight undertone of righteous fury. “Let Hermione, the first Granger, be brought forth.” “I ask you all to remember that she is a first-year of Hogwarts,” Dum- bledore said. “I will brook no abuse of this witness—” Someone in the benches quite audibly said “Pfah!” and there was a spread of disgusted snorts, even one or two jeers. Harry stared at the plum-coloured robes, his eyes narrowing. And with the growing anger came something else, a rising sense of disquiet, of something horribly skewed, like reality itself was being dis- rupted. Harry knew that, somehow, but he couldn’t figure out what was awry, or why his mind thought it was getting worse… “Order!” Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped the stone rod twice against the podium, producing two more small clicks that overrode all noise. “I will have order here!” The door through which the witness was brought forth was set directly beneath Harry’s own seat, so it wasn’t until the entire group had emerged fully into the stone hall that Harry saw— —an Auror trio— —Hermione’s back was to Harry as she was brought out, he couldn’t see her face— —followed by a shining silver sparrow and a running moonlit squirrel— —and the source of the horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath a tattered cloak. Harry shot to his feet before he could even think, it was only Profes- sor McGonagall’s sudden frantic grab on his wrist that stopped his hand going for his wand; and the Transfiguration Professor whispered desper- ately, “Harry it’s all right there’s a Patronus—” It took a few seconds for Harry to remember himself. For the part of himself that understood that Hermione hadn’t been directly exposed to a Dementor, to argue his other parts into something like sanity— But animal Patronuses aren’t perfect, said another voice inside his mind. Or Dumbledore wouldn’t see the form of a naked man painful to look upon. You felt it approaching, animal Patronus or no… Slowly, Harry Potter sat back down again as Professor McGonagall pulled down with her grip on his wrist. But by then he’d already declared war on the country of magical Britain, and the idea of other people calling him a Dark Lord no longer seemed important one way or another. Hermione’s face became visible to him, as she sat down in the chair. She wasn’t upright and defiant like she’d been in front of Snape, she wasn’t crying like she’d been when the Aurors arrested her. She just sat there with a look of vacant horror as dark metal chains snaked out from the chair and bound her arms and legs. Harry couldn’t take it. Without even thinking he was trying to flee in- side himself, flee into his dark side, pull the cold rage over himself like a shield. It took too long, he hadn’t tried to go fully into his dark side since Azkaban. And then when his blood was something like cold, he looked up again, and saw Hermione in the chair again, and discovered that his dark side knew nothing about how to deal with this type of pain, it pierced through the coldness like a knife and didn’t hurt less in the slightest. “Why, if it isn’t Harry Potter!” came a high, light female voice, sickly sweet and indulgent. Slowly, Harry turned his head away from the chair and saw a smiling woman wearing so much make-up that her skin looked almost pink, sit- ting next to a man that Harry recognized from photographs as Minister Cornelius Fudge. “Did you have something to say, Mr Potter?” inquired the woman, as cheerfully as if this wasn’t a trial. Other people were also looking at him now. Harry couldn’t speak, all the words in his mind would have been stupid to speak aloud. He couldn’t find anything to say that Neville could also have said. Dumbledore had warned Harry that if anyone else wanted the Boy-Who-Lived to speak, he must pretend to be his age— “The Headmaster said I shouldn’t talk,” the boy said, not quite able to keep the edge out of his voice. “Oh, but you have our permission to talk!” the woman said brightly. “I’m sure the Wizengamot is always happy to hear from the Boy-Who- Lived!” Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge was nodding. The woman’s face was puffy and overweight, visibly pale beneath the make-up. Almost inevitably, a certain word came to mind, and that word was toad. Which, said Harry’s logical part, shouldn’t correlate to morality in any way. Only in Disney films were ugly people more likely to be evil and vice versa; and those films were probably scripted by writers who’d never been ugly. He’d give her a chance, everyone in this room deserved one chance… “Because I got rid of the Dark Lord?” the boy said, and pointed at the Dementor where it was hovering behind Hermione’s chair. “There’s some- thing in this room that’s Darker.” The woman’s face narrowed, growing a little stern. “I realize a young boy like yourself may be scared by them, Mr Potter, but the Dementors are quite obedient to the Ministry of Magic. And they would, of course, be necessary to guard—” “A twelve-year-old girl?” the boy yelled. “Those are the Darkest crea- tures in the whole world, I could feel it coming here even through the Patronus—the wrongness coming nearer—it’s horribly evil and it—it’d eat everyone in this room, if it could! It shouldn’t be let near any child, ever! Not me, not her, not anyone! You ought to vote to send it away!” “We’ll certainly have no such vote—” the toad-woman snapped. “That’s enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr Potter,” came Dumbledore’s stern voice from high above. And then after a short pause, the old wizard went on, “Although, of course, the boy is correct on every count.” Some of the members of the Wizengamot were looking abashed at the Boy-Who-Lived’s admonition, and a few others were nodding violently to the old wizard’s words. But they were too few. Harry could see it. They were too few. The Veritaserum was brought in then, and Hermione looked for a brief moment like she was about to sob, she was looking at Harry—no, at Pro- fessor McGonagall—and Professor McGonagall was mouthing words that Harry couldn’t make out from his angle. Then Hermione swallowed three drops of Veritaserum and her face grew slack. “Gawain Robards,” said the smooth voice of Lucius Malfoy. “Your pro- bity is known to all of us. If you would do the honours?” One of the three Aurors stepped forward. After the first few questions Harry looked away and stared off to one side with his fingers in his ears, as Hermione’s brain played back the con- tents of the False Memory Charm. He couldn’t handle the drug-dulled an- guish in Hermione’s voice as she recounted the false memories, and his dark side couldn’t handle it either, and he’d already heard the contents summarized. Harry’s mind flashed back to another day of horror, and even though Harry had been on the verge of writing off Lord Voldemort’s continued existence as the senility of an old wizard, it suddenly seemed horribly and uniquely plausible that the entity who’d Memory-Charmed Hermi- one was the very same mind that had—made use of —Bellatrix Black. The two events had a certain signature in common. To choose that this should happen, plan for this to happen—it would take more than evil, it would take emptiness. Harry looked up for a moment, then, and saw that the plum-coloured robes were watching, just watching. Some time later, after all the stars in the night sky had gone cold and dark and the last light in the Universe had sputtered down to embers and gone black, the questioning of Hermione ended. “If it pleases my Lords,” said the voice of Lord Malfoy, “I should like to have the testimony of my son Draco, witnessed under two drops of Veri- taserum, read aloud at this time.” Until she went after me in that battle, I wasn’t plotting anything against Gran- ger. But after that day I really was feeling insulted, I’d helped her all those times— The sound that came from Hermione’s throat was like she’d just been crushed under a falling stone, so huge that she couldn’t cry or breathe, just a small sad gasp. “Pardon me,” said one witch from what seemed to be the Malfoy- aligned side of the room. “But Lord Malfoy, why would your son help this mudblood girl?” “My son,” Lucius Malfoy said in a heavy voice, “seems to have been lis- tening to certain misguided ideas. He is young—and he has learned, now, we have all seen as a country, what such folly brings in repayment.” A few steps down along the visitor’s benches, a man wearing a news- man’s cap and a badge identifying him as belonging to the Daily Prophet was avidly scribbling with a long quill. The few people who’d nodded along to Dumbledore earlier had rather sick looks on their faces. One witch in plum-coloured robes quite deliber- ately stood up from what had seemed like Dumbledore’s side of the room, and made her way over toward the Malfoy side. The Auror went on reading, his voice monotone. “I’d been so tired from casting all those locking wards, I was weak when I cast the last one. I thought I was stronger than Granger but I wasn’t certain, so I tested it empirically by challenging her to a duel, that’s why I d-d-did it and also because if I’d won I was planning to beat her again the next day where everyone could see. Stupid Veritaserum. But she didn’t know about that when she tried to kill me! And I really was insulted by what she’d done, I really had helped her before and I hadn’t been planning anything against her then, only she went after me in front of everyone!” When all the witness testimony was done, the deliberations of the Wi- zengamot began. If you could call them that. It seemed that many members of the Wizengamot were of the strong opinion that murder was bad. The plum-coloured robes on Dumbledore’s side of the room were silent, the supposed forces of good saving their political capital for more winnable battles. And Harry could hear, as though Professor Quirrell were standing next to him, a dry voice in his mind; explaining to him that it would hardly have been to the politicians’ own advantage to speak, just then. But there was one wizard in the room whose status was high enough that he had, it seemed, transcended his caution against losing face; one wizard alone whose status was high enough that he could speak a word of sanity and escape unscathed. He alone spoke to defend Hermione, the man with a phœnix flaming bright upon his shoulder. Only Albus Dumbledore spoke. The Chief Warlock didn’t raise the possibility that Hermione Gran- ger was entirely innocent. That, the Headmaster had explained to Harry, would not be believed, would only make it worse. But Albus Dumbledore said, in one gentle reminder after another, that the perpetrator was a first-year girl in Hogwarts; that many had done foolish things during their youth; that a first-year in Hogwarts was simply too young to comprehend the consequences of her acts. He him- self (the Chief Warlock said quietly) had attempted certain foolish things during his childhood, when he was well older than she. Albus Dumbledore said that Hermione Granger had been beloved of all the Hogwarts faculty, and helped four Hufflepuff girls with their Charms homework, and had scored one hundred and three points for Ravenclaw over the course of the school year. Albus Dumbledore said that nobody who knew Hermione Granger would be anything but shocked by these events. That they had, all of them, heard the horror in her voice as she recounted her testimony. And if some unusual madness had temporarily possessed her, then—his voice rising in stern command—she deserved nothing from them except sympathy and a healer’s attentions. And at the last, Albus Dumbledore reminded the Wizengamot, over cries of protest, that the charge was attempted murder and not murder. Albus Dumbledore said, over a rising storm of objections, that no lasting harm had come to anyone. And Albus Dumbledore begged them not to do worse themselves than anything that had yet been done— “Enough!” bellowed Lucius Malfoy, and a show of hands ended the de- liberations. The white-maned man stood tall and terrible, his silver cane held high in one hand like a gavel about to fall. “For what this mad woman has tried to do to my son—for the blood debt that she owes for trying to end the line of a Noble and Most Ancient House—I say that she will—” “Azkaban!” roared a man with a scarred face, seated at Lord Malfoy’s right hand. “Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!” “Azkaban!” cried another plum-coloured robe, and then another, and another— A click from the rod in Dumbledore’s hand silenced the room. “You are out of order,” the old wizard said sternly. “And your proposal is barbaric, beneath the dignity of this assembly. There are things we do not do. Lord Malfoy?” Lucius Malfoy had listened to this with an impassive face. “Well,” Lord Malfoy said after a few moments. A cold gleam lit his eyes. “I had not planned to ask it. But if that is the will of the Wizengamot—then let her pay as any in her place would pay. Let it be Azkaban.” A great cheer of rage went up— “Are you all lost?” cried Albus Dumbledore. “She is too young! Her mind would not withstand it! Not in three centuries has such a thing been done in Britain!” “What will the other countries think of us?” said the sharp voice of a woman that Harry recognized as Neville’s grandmother. “Will you guard Azkaban after she goes there, Lord Malfoy?” said a stern old witch that Harry didn’t know. “For my Aurors may decline to guard it, I fear, if small children are kept within.” “The deliberations are ended,” Lucius Malfoy said coldly. “But if you are incapable of finding Aurors who can obey the vote of the Wizengamot, Madam Bones, you may relinquish the position; we can easily find an- other to serve in your place. The will of this Hall is clear. For the mon- strosity of her crimes, the girl is to be tried as an adult and punished accordingly; ten years in Azkaban, the justice for attempted murder.” When the old wizard spoke again, his voice was lower. “Is there no alternative to this, Lucius? We may retire to my chambers to discuss it, if need be.” The tall man of the long white hair turned, then, to regard where the old wizard stood at the podium; and the two stared at each other for a long moment. When Lucius Malfoy spoke again his voice seemed to tremble ever so slightly, as though the stern control on it was failing. “Blood calls for re- payment, the blood of my family. Not for any price will I sell the blood debt owed my son. You would not understand that, who never had love or child of your own. Still, there is more than one debt owed to House Malfoy, and I think that my son, if he stood among us, would rather be repaid for his mother’s blood than for his own. Confess your own crime to the Wizengamot, as you confessed it to me, and I shall—” “Don’t even think about it, Albus,” said the stern old witch who had spoken before. The old wizard stood at the podium. The old wizard stood at the podium, his face twisting, untwisting— “Stop it,” said the old witch. “You know the answer you must give, Al- bus. It will not change for agonizing over it.” The old wizard spoke. “No,” said Albus Dumbledore. “And you, Malfoy,” continued the stern old witch, “I suppose all you really wanted this whole time was to ruin—” “Hardly,” said Lucius Malfoy, his lips now twisting into a bitter smile. “No, I have no purpose here but my son’s vengeance. I only wished to show the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man’s pretended heroism and his praise of that girl—that he would hardly think of sacrificing himself to save her.” “Cruelty worthy of a Death Eater indeed,” said Augusta Longbottom. “Not that I’m implying anything, of course.” “Cruelty?” said Lucius Malfoy, the bitter smile still on his face. “I think not. I knew what his answer would be. I have ever warned you that he only plays his pretended part. If you believe in his hesitation, the more fool you. Remember that his answer was the same.” The man raised his voice. “Let us vote, my friends. I think a show of hands will suffice for it. I do not imagine there will be many who choose to align themselves with murderers.” The voice went cold, on the last note, the promise in it very clear. “Look at the girl,” said Albus Dumbledore. “See her, see the horror you are committing! She is—” The old wizard’s voice broke. “She is afraid—” The Veritaserum must have been wearing off, because Hermione Granger’s face was twisting beneath the slackness, her limbs trembling visibly beneath the chains, as though she were trying to run, run from that chair, but was pressed down by weights larger than the enchanted metal links that bound her. Then there was a convulsive effort and Her- mione’s neck moved, her head twisted, enough to bring her eyes into line— She looked at Harry Potter and though she didn’t speak, it was abso- lutely clear what she was saying. Harry help me please— And in the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot an icy voice rang out, speech the colour of liquid nitrogen, pitched too high for that it came from too young a throat, and that voice said, “Lucius Malfoy.” 1324 TABOO TRADE-OFFS II: THE HORNS EFFECT Harry’s blood was hammering even beneath the ice of his dark side, the fear for Hermione, the part of him that wanted to lash out at Lu- cius and destroy him where he stood for his insolence and his stupidity— but Harry didn’t have the power, he didn’t even have a single vote in the Wizengamot— Draco had said that Lucius was scared of him, for some unknown rea- son. And Harry could see it in the rictus that Lord Malfoy’s face had be- come, drawn and tight, that it was taking all his courage for him to tell Harry to shut up. So Harry said, his voice cool and deadly, hoping to hell that it meant something, “You will earn my enmity if you do this thing, Lucius…” Someone in the lower rows of what was evidently the blood-purist side of the Wizengamot, who was looking down at the young boy rather than up at Lord Malfoy, laughed in outright incredulity. Other plum-coloured robes began to laugh as well. Lord Malfoy gazed at him with hard dignity, as that laughter spread. “If you want the enmity of the House of Malfoy, you shall have it, child.” “Now really,” said the woman in too much pink make-up, “I think this has gone on quite long enough, wouldn’t you say, Lord Malfoy? The boy will miss his classes.” “Indeed he will,” said Lucius Malfoy, and then raised his voice again. “I call the vote! By show of hands, let the Wizengamot acknowledge the blood debt owed to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, for the attempted murder of its last scion and ending of its line, by Hermione, the first Granger!” Hands shot up one after another, and the secretary who sat in the bot- tom circle began to make marks on parchment to tally them, but it was obvious which way the majority had gone. And Harry screamed inside his mind, a frantic call for help to any part of himself that would offer a way out, a strategy, an idea. But there was nothing, there was nothing, he’d played his last cards and lost. And then with a last convulsive desperation Harry plunged himself into his dark side, pushed himself into his dark side, seizing at its deadly clarity, of- fering his dark side anything if it would only solve this problem for him; and at last the lethal calm came over him, the true ice finally answering his call. Beyond all panic and despair his mind began to search through every fact in its possession, recall everything it knew about Lucius Malfoy, about the Wizengamot, about the laws of magical Britain; his eyes looked at the rows of chairs, at every person and every thing within range of his vision, searching for any opportunity it could grasp— CHAPTER EIGHT Y-ONE TABOO TRADE-OFFS, PART III In rising half-circles of dark stone, a great sea of upraised hands. The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, in plum-coloured robes marked with a silver ‘W’, stared down in stern rebuke at a young girl trembling in chains. If they had, in any particular ethical system, damned themselves, they clearly thought quite highly of themselves for having done so. Harry’s breath was trembling in his chest. His dark side had come up with a plan—and then rotated itself back out again because speaking too icily would not be to Hermione’s advantage; a fact which the only-half- cold Harry had somehow not realized… “The vote carries, in favour,” intoned the secretary, when all the tally- ing was done, and the upraised hands fell back down. “The Wizengamot recognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to House Malfoy for the attempted murder of its scion and ending of its line.” Lucius Malfoy was smiling in grim satisfaction. “And now,” said the white-maned wizard, “I say that her debt shall be paid—” Harry clenched his fists beneath the bench and shouted, “By the debt owed from House Malfoy to House Potter!” “Silence!” snapped the woman in too much pink make-up sitting next to Minister Fudge. “You’ve disrupted these proceedings quite enough al- ready! Aurors, escort him out!” “Wait,” said Augusta Longbottom from the top tier of seats. “What debt is this?” Lucius’s hands whitened on his cane. “House Malfoy owes no debt to you!” It wasn’t the world’s most solid hope, it was based on one newspa- per article from a woman who’d been False-Memory-Charmed, but Rita Skeeter had seemed to find it plausible, that Mr Weasley had allegedly owed James Potter a debt because… “I’m surprised you’ve forgotten,” Harry said evenly. “Surely it was a cruel and painful period of your life, labouring under the Imperius curse of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed of it by the efforts of House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who died for it, and by my father, James Potter, who died for it, and by me, of course.” There was a brief silence within the Most Ancient Hall. “Why, what an excellent point, Mr Potter,” said the old witch who’d been identified as Madam Bones. “I, too, am quite surprised that Lord Malfoy would forget such a significant event. It must have been such a happy day for him.” “Yes,” said Augusta Longbottom. “He must have been so grateful.” Madam Bones nodded. “House Malfoy could not possibly deny that debt—unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy is to tell us that he has misremem- bered something? I should take quite a professional interest in that. We are always trying to improve our picture of those dark days.” Lucius Malfoy’s hands gripped the silver snake-handle of his cane like he was about to strike with it, unleash whatever power it kept— Then the Lord Malfoy seemed to relax, and a chill smile came over his face. “Of course,” he said easily. “I do confess I had not understood, but the child is quite correct. But I do not quite think the two debts cancel— House Potter was only trying to save itself, after all—” “Not so,” Dumbledore said from above. “—and therefore,” intoned Lucius Malfoy, “I demand monetary com- pensation as well, for the redemption of the blood debt owed my son. That, too, is the law.” Harry felt a strange inward flinch. That had also been in the news- paper article, Mr Weasley had demanded an additional ten thousand Galleons— “How much?” said the Boy-Who-Lived. Lucius was still wearing the cold smile. “One hundred thousand Galleons. If you have not that much in your vault, I suppose I must accept a promissory note for the remainder.” A roar of protest went up from Dumbledore’s side of the room, even some of the plum-coloured robes in the middle looked shocked. “Shall we put it to vote of the Wizengamot?” said Lucius Malfoy. “I think few of us would like to see the little murderess go free. By a show of hands, that additional compensation of one hundred thousand Galleons would be required to cancel the debt!” The clerk began tallying, but that vote was also clear. Harry stood there, breathing deeply. You’d better not even have to think about this, Harry’s inner Gryffindor said threateningly. It’s a major purchase, observed Ravenclaw. We ought to spend a lot of time thinking about it. It shouldn’t have been hard. It shouldn’t have. Two million pounds was only money, and money was only worth what it could buy… It was strange how much psychological attachment you could have to ‘only money’, or how painful it could be to imagine losing a bank vault full of gold that you hadn’t even imagined existed just one year earlier. Kimball Kinnison wouldn’t hesitate, said Gryffindor. Seriously. Like, snap decision. What sort of hero are you? I already hate you just for having to think about it for longer than 50 milliseconds. This is real life, said Ravenclaw. Losing all your money is a lot more painful for real people in real life than in heroic books. What? demanded Gryffindor. Whose side are you on? I wasn’t advocating for a particular answer, said Ravenclaw, I was just saying it because it was true. Could a hundred thousand Galleons be used to save more than one life if spent some other way? said Slytherin. We have research to do, battles to fight, the dif- ference between being 40,000 Galleons rich and being 60,000 Galleons in debt is not trivial— So we’ll just use one of our ways to make money fast and earn it all back, said Hufflepuff. It’s not certain those will work, said Slytherin, and a lot of them require start- ing cash— Personally, said Gryffindor, I vote that we save Hermione and then gang up and kill our inner Slytherin. The clerk’s voice said that the tally had been recorded and the vote had passed… Harry’s lips opened. “I accept your offer,” said Harry’s lips, without any hesitation, without any decision having been made; just as if the internal debate had been pretence and illusion, the true controller of the voice having been no part of it. Lucius Malfoy’s mask of calm shattered, his eyes widened, he stared at Harry in sheer blank astonishment. His mouth had opened slightly, though he wasn’t speaking, and if he was making any peculiar noises it couldn’t be heard over the roar of simultaneous gasps from the Wizengamot— A tap of stone silenced the crowd. “No,” said the voice of Dumbledore. Harry’s head jerked around to stare at the ancient wizard. Dumbledore’s lined face was pale, the silver beard was visibly trem- bling, he looked like he was in the final throes of a terminal illness. “I’m— sorry, Harry—but this choice is not yours—for I am still the guardian of your vault.” “What?” said Harry, too shocked to compose his reply. “I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I cannot! You do not know—you do not realize—” DIE. Harry didn’t even know which part of himself had spoken, it might have been a unanimous vote, the pure rage and fury pouring through him. For an instant he thought that the sheer force of the anger might take mag- ical wing and fly out to strike the Headmaster, send him tumbling back dead from the podium— But when that mental voice had spoken, the old wizard was still stand- ing there, gazing at Harry, long dark wand in his right hand, short black rod in his left. And Harry’s eyes also went to the red-golden bird with its claws rest- ing on the shoulder of Dumbledore’s black robes, silent when no phœnix should have been silent. “Fawkes,” Harry said, his voice sounding strange in his own ears, “can you scream at him for me?” The fiery bird on the old wizard’s shoulder didn’t scream. Maybe the Wizengamot had demanded that a spell of silence be put on the creature, otherwise it probably would have been screaming the whole time. But Fawkes hit his master, one golden wing buffeting the old wizard’s head. “I cannot, Harry!” the old wizard said, the agony clear in his voice. “I am doing as I must do!” And Harry knew, then, as he looked at the red-golden bird, what he had to do as well. It should have been obvious from the beginning, that solution. “Then I too will do what I must,” Harry said up to Dumbledore, as though the two of them stood alone in the room. “You do realize that, don’t you?” The old wizard shook his trembling head. “You will change your mind when you are older—” “I’m not talking about that,” Harry said, his voice still strange in his own ears. “I mean that I will not allow Hermione Granger to be eaten by Dementors under any circumstances. Period. Regardless of what any law says, and no matter what I have to do to stop it. Do I still need to spell it out?” A strange male voice spoke from somewhere far away, “Be sure that the girl is taken directly to Azkaban, and put under extra guard.” Harry waited, staring at the old wizard, and then spoke again. “I will go to Azkaban,” Harry said to the old wizard, as though they stood alone in the world, “before Hermione can be taken there, and start snapping my fingers. It may cost me my life, but by the time she gets there, there won’t be an Azkaban any more.” Some members of the Wizengamot gasped in surprise. Then a greater number started laughing. “How would you even get there, little boy?” someone said, from among those who were laughing. “I have my ways of getting to places,” said the boy’s distant voice. Harry kept his eyes on Dumbledore, on the old wizard staring at him in shock. Harry didn’t look directly at Fawkes, didn’t give his plan away; but in his mind he prepared to summon the phœnix to transport him, prepared to fill his mind with light and fury, to call for the fire-bird with all his might, he might have to do it upon the instant if Dumbledore pointed his wand— “Would you truly?” the old wizard said to Harry, also as if the two of them stood alone in the room. The room went silent again as everyone stared in shock at the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, who seemed to be taking the mad threat completely seriously. The old wizard’s eyes were locked only on Harry. “Would you risk everything—everything—only for her?” “Yes,” Harry said back in reply. That’s the wrong answer, you know, said Slytherin. Seriously. But it’s the true answer. “You will not see reason?” said the old wizard. “Apparently not,” Harry said back. The gazes stayed locked. “This is terrible folly,” said the old wizard. “I am aware of this,” answered the hero. “Now get out of my way.” Strange light glinted in the ancient blue eyes. “As you will, Harry Pot- ter, but know that this is not over.” The rest of the world faded back into existence. “I withdraw my objection,” said the old wizard, “Harry Potter may do as he wishes,” and the Wizengamot exploded in a roar of shock, only to be silenced by a final tap of the stone rod. Harry turned his head back to look at Lord Malfoy, who looked like he’d seen a cat turn into a person and start eating other cats. To call the look confused did not begin to describe it. “You would truly…” Lucius Malfoy said slowly. “You would truly pay a hundred thousand Galleons, to save one mudblood girl.” “I think there’s about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,” Harry said. It was strange how that was still causing more internal pain than the thought of taking an over-fifty-percent risk to his life to destroy Azkaban. “As for the other sixty thousand—what are the rules, exactly?” “It comes due when you graduate Hogwarts,” the old wizard said from high above. “But Lord Malfoy has certain rights over you before then, I fear.” Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning down at Harry. “Who is she to you, then? What is she to you, that you would pay so much to keep her from harm?” “My friend,” the boy said quietly. Lucius Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “By the report I received, you cannot cast the Patronus Charm, and Dumbledore knows this. The power of a sin- gle Dementor nearly killed you. You would not dare venture near Azkaban in your own person—” “That was in January,” said Harry. “This is April.” Lucius Malfoy’s eyes remained cool and calculating. “You pretend you can destroy Azkaban, and Dumbledore pretends to believe it.” Harry did not reply. The white-haired man turned slightly, toward the centre of the half- circle, as though to address the greater Wizengamot. “I withdraw my of- fer!” shouted the Lord of Malfoy. “I will not accept the debt to House Potter in payment, not even for a hundred thousand Galleons! The girl’s blood debt to House Malfoy stands!” Again the roar of many voices. “Dishonourable!” someone cried. “You acknowledge the debt to House Potter, and yet you would—” and then that voice cut off. “I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me to ac- cept it in cancellation,” said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile. “The girl is no part of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter is no debt to her. As for the dishonour—” Lucius Malfoy paused. “As for the grave shame I feel at my ingratitude toward the Potters, who have done so much for me—” Lucius Malfoy bowed his head. “May my ancestors forgive me.” “Well, boy?” called the scarred man sitting at Lord Malfoy’s right hand. “Go and destroy Azkaban, then!” “I’d like to see that,” said another voice. “Will you be selling tickets?” It went without saying that Harry didn’t pick this particular moment to give up. The girl is no part of House Potter— He had, in fact, seen the obvious way out of the dilemma almost in- stantly. It might have taken him longer if he hadn’t recently overheard a num- ber of conversations between older Ravenclaw girls, and read a certain number of Quibbler stories. He was, nonetheless, having trouble accepting it. This is ridiculous, said a part of Harry which had just dubbed itself the Internal Consistency Checker. Our actions here are completely incoherent. First you feel less emotional reluctance to risk your bloody life and probably die for Hermione, than to part with a stupid heap of gold. And now you’re baulking just at getting married? SYSTEM ERROR. You know what? said Internal Consistency Checker. You’re stupid. I didn’t say no, thought Harry. I was just saying SYSTEM ERROR. I vote for destroying Azkaban, said Gryffindor. It needs to be done anyway. Really, really stupid, said Internal Consistency Checker. Oh, screw this, I’m assuming control of our body. The boy took a deep breath, and opened his mouth— By this point Harry Potter had entirely forgotten the existence of Pro- fessor McGonagall, who had been sitting there this whole time undergo- ing a number of interesting changes of facial expression which Harry had not been looking at because he was distracted. It would have been overly harsh to say that Harry had forgotten her because he did not consider her a PC. It could be more kindly said that Professor McGonagall was not vis- ibly a solution to any of his current problems, and therefore she was not part of the universe. So Harry, who at this point had a fair amount of adrenaline in his bloodstream, started and jumped quite visibly when Professor McGon- agall, her eyes now blazing with impossible hope and the tears on her cheek half-dried, leapt to her feet and cried, “With me, Mr Potter!” and, without waiting for a reply, tore down the stairs that led to the bottom platform where waited a chair of dark metal. It took a moment, but Harry ran after; though it took him longer to reach the bottom, after Professor McGonagall vaulted half the stairs with a strange catlike motion and landed with the astonished-looking Auror trio already pointing their wands at her. “Miss Granger!” cried Professor McGonagall. “Can you speak yet?” Much as with Professor McGonagall, there was a certain sense in which it could be said that Harry had forgotten about the existence of Hermione Granger, because Harry had been tilting his neck back to look upward rather than downward, and because he hadn’t considered her a solution to any of his current problems. Though it was hardly certain, in fact it wasn’t at all probable, that Harry remembering to look at Hermi- one or think about what she must be feeling, would have helped anything in the slightest. Harry reached the bottom of the stairs and saw Hermione Granger full on— Without thinking, without being able to help himself, Harry shut his eyes, but he’d seen. Her school robes around her neck, soaked all the way through with tears. The way she’d been looking away from him. And the eye of memory and sympathy, which could not be shut, which could not look away, knew that Hermione had recounted the worst shame of her life in front of the nobility of magical Britain and Professor McGon- agall and Dumbledore and Harry; and then been sentenced to Azkaban where she would be exposed to darkness and cold and all her worst mem- ories until she went mad and died; and then she’d heard that Harry was going to give away all his money and go into debt to save her, and maybe even sacrifice his life; and with the Dementor standing only a few paces behind her, she hadn’t said anything… “Y-yes,” whispered the voice of Hermione Granger. “I c-can talk.” Harry opened his eyes again and saw her face, now looking at him. It didn’t say anything like what he thought Hermione was feeling, faces couldn’t say anything that complicated, all facial muscles could do was contort themselves into knots. “H-H-Harry, I-I’m so, I’m so—” “Shut up,” Harry suggested. “s-s-sorry—” “If you’d never met me on the train you wouldn’t be in any trouble right now. So shut up,” said Harry Potter. “Both of you stop being silly,” Professor McGonagall said in her firm Scottish accent (it was strange how much that helped). “Mr Potter, hold out your wand so that Miss Granger’s fingers can touch it. Miss Granger, repeat after me. Upon my life and magic—” Harry did as he was bid, thrusting his wand forward to touch Hermi- one’s fingers; and then Hermione’s faltering voice said, “Upon my life and magic—” “I swear service to the House of Potter—” said Professor McGonagall. And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions, said, the words spilling out of her in a rush, “I swear service to the House of Potter, to obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at their right hand, and fight at their command, and follow where they go, until the day I die.” All those words had been blurted out in a desperate gasp before Harry could have thought or said anything, if he’d been mad enough to inter- rupt. “Mr Potter, repeat these words,” said Professor McGonagall. “I, Harry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service, until the end of the world and its magic.” Harry took a breath and said, “I, Harry, heir and last scion of the Pot- ters, accept your service, until the end of the world and its magic.” “That’s it,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well done.” Harry looked up, and saw that the entire Wizengamot, whose exis- tence he’d forgotten, was staring at them. And then Minerva McGonagall, who was Head of House Gryffindor even if she didn’t always act like it, looked up high above at where Lucius Malfoy stood; and she said to him before the entire Wizengamot, “I regret every point I ever gave you in Transfiguration, you vile little worm.” Whatever Lucius was about to say in reply was silenced by a tap of the short rod in Dumbledore’s hand. “Ahem!” said the old wizard from his podium of dark stone. “This session has carried on quite considerably, and if it is not dismissed soon, some of us may miss their entire luncheon. The law of this matter is clear. You have already voted on the terms of the bargain, and Lord Malfoy cannot legally decline it. As we have far ex- ceeded our allotted time, I now, in accordance with the last decision of the survivors of the eighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn this session.” The old wizard tapped the rod of dark stone three times. “You fools!” shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair was shaking as though in a wind, the face beneath was pale with fury. “Do you think you’ll get away with what you’ve done today? Do you think that girl can try to murder my son and escape unscathed?” The toad-like pink–make-up woman, whose name Harry could no longer remember, was standing up from her seat. “Why, of course not,” she said with a sickening smile. “After all, the girl is still a murderess, and I think the Ministry shall be watching her affairs quite closely—it hardly seems wise that she should be allowed to wander the streets, after all—” Harry was fed up at this point. Without waiting to listen, Harry turned on his heel and strode for- ward in long steps toward— The horror only he could truly see, the absence of colour and space, the wound in the world, above which floated a tattered cloak; most im- perfectly guarded by a running moonlit squirrel and fluttering silver spar- row. His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the entire room for anything that could possibly be used as a weapon, that the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into Harry’s presence. That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that Harry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been a time in Azkaban when Harry had told twelve Dementors to turn and go, and they had gone. The Dementors are Death, and the Patronus Charm works by thinking about happy thoughts instead of Death. If Harry’s theory was correct, that one sentence would be all it took to pop the Aurors’ Patronus Charms like a soap bubble, and ensure that nobody within reach of his voice could cast another one. I am going to cancel the Patronus Charms and prevent any more Patronuses from being cast. And then my Dementor, flying faster than any broomstick, is going to Kiss everyone here who voted to send a twelve-year-old girl to Azkaban. Say that, to set up the if-then expectation, and wait for people to un- derstand and laugh. Then speak the fatal truth; and when the Aurors’ Pa- tronuses winked out to prove the point, either people’s anticipations of the mindless void, or Harry’s threat of its destruction, would make the De- mentor obey. Those who had sought to compromise with the darkness would be consumed by it. It was the other solution his dark side had devised. Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the radius of the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its unhindered fear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping next to the suck- ing drain of some huge bathtub emptying out its water; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level on which they interacted, Harry could reach the Dementor even as it could reach him. Harry looked straight into the pulling vacuum and— the Earth among the stars all his triumph at saving Hermione some day the reality of which you are a shadow will cease to exist Harry took all the silver emotion that fuelled his Patronus Charm and shoved it at the Dementor; and expected Death’s shadow to flee from him— —and as Harry did that, he flung his hands up and shouted “Boo!” The void retreated sharply away from Harry until it came up against the dark stone behind. In the hall there was a deathly silence. Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where the toad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink make-up, her mouth opening and closing like a fish. “I make you this one offer,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “I never learn that you’ve been interfering with me or any of mine. And you never find out why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of me. Now sit down and shut up.” The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word. Harry looked further up. “A riddle, Lord Malfoy!” the Boy-Who-Lived shouted across the Most Ancient Hall. “I know you weren’t in Ravenclaw, but try to answer this one anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens Dementors, and owes you sixty thousand Galleons?” For an instant Lord Malfoy stood there with eyes slightly widened; then his face fell back into calm scorn, and his voice spoke coolly in reply. “Are you openly threatening me, Mr Potter?” “I’m not threatening you,” said the Boy-Who-Lived. “I’m scaring you. There’s a difference.” “Enough, Mr Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “We shall be late for afternoon Transfiguration as it is. And do come back here, you’re still ter- rifying that poor Dementor.” She turned to the Aurors. “Mr Kleiner, if you would!” Harry strode back to them, as the Auror addressed moved forward and pressed a short rod of dark metal to the dark metal chair, muttering an inaudible word of dismissal. The chains slithered back as smoothly as they had come forth; and Her- mione pushed herself out of the chair as fast as she could, and half-ran and half-staggered forward a few steps. Harry held out his arms— —and Hermione half-jumped half-fell into Professor McGonagall’s arms, beginning to sob hysterically. Hmpfh, said a voice inside Harry. I kind of thought we’d earned that one ourselves. Oh, shut up. Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that you might have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybe granddaughter. After a few moments Hermione’s sobs slowed, and then stopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and grabbed onto her more tightly; the girl’s hands were dangling limply, now, and her eyes were closed— “She’ll be fine, Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall said softly in Harry’s direction, without looking at him. “She just needs a few hours in one of Madam Pomfrey’s beds.” “All right, then,” Harry said. “Let’s get her to Madam Pomfrey’s.” “Yes,” said Dumbledore, as he descended to the bottom of the dark stone stairs. “Let us all go home, indeed.” His blue eyes were locked on Harry, as hard as sapphires. 1342 TABOO TRADE-OFFS III 1343 CH APTER 81 1344 1345 CH APTER 82 When Harry had fully lit up again he was standing in the Headmas- ter’s office, amid the noises of a dozen dozen inscrutable gadgets. The young boy took a step away from the old wizard and then turned on him, emerald and sapphire eyes meeting. The two of them did not speak for a time, looking at each other; as though all they had to speak could be said only by stares, and not said in any other way. In time the boy enunciated words slowly and precisely. “I cannot believe that a phœnix is still upon your shoulder.” “The phœnix chooses but once,” said the old wizard. “They might per- haps leave a master who chooses evil over good; they will not leave a mas- ter forced to choose between one good and another. Phœnixes are not arrogant. They know the limits of their own wisdom.” Stern indeed, that ancient gaze. “Unlike you, Harry.” “Choose between one good and another,” Harry echoed flatly. “Like Hermione Granger’s life, versus a hundred thousand Galleons.” The rage and indignation Harry wanted to put into his voice wasn’t quite there, for some reason, maybe because— “You are hardly in a position to speak to me of that, Harry Potter.” The Headmaster’s voice was deceptively soft. “Or what was that look of reluc- tance that I saw upon your face, there in the Most Ancient Hall?” The sense of inward hollowness grew worse. “I was looking for other alternatives,” Harry growled. “Some way to save her that didn’t lose the money.” Wow, said Ravenclaw. You just told an outright lie. Not only that, I think you actually believed it for the seconds it took to say it. That’s kinda scary. “Is that what you were thinking, Harry?” The blue eyes were keen, and there was a terrifying moment when Harry wondered if the world’s most powerful wizard could see right past his Occlumency barriers. “Yes,” Harry said, “I flinched away from the pain of losing all the money in my vault. But I did it! That’s what counts! And you—” The indignation that had faltered out of Harry’s voice returned. “You actually put a price on Hermione Granger’s life, and you put it below a hundred thousand Galleons!” “Oh?” the old wizard said softly. “And what price do you put on her life, then? A million Galleons?” “Are you familiar with the economic concept of ‘replacement value’?” The words were spilling from Harry’s lips almost faster than he could con- sider them. “Hermione’s replacement value is infinite! There’s nowhere I can go to buy another one!” Now you’re just talking mathematical nonsense, said Slytherin. Ravenclaw, back me up here? “Is Minerva’s life also of infinite worth?” the old wizard said harshly. “Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?” “Yes and yes,” Harry snapped. “That’s part of Professor McGonagall’s job and she knows it.” “Then Minerva’s value is not infinite,” said the old wizard, “for all that she is loved. There can only be one king upon a chessboard, Harry Potter, only one piece that you will sacrifice any other piece to save. And Hermi- one Granger is not that piece. Make no mistake, Harry Potter, this day you may well have lost your war.” And if the old wizard’s words hadn’t hit quite so hard, and quite so close to home, Harry might not have said what he said then. “Lucius was right,” Harry ground out. “You never had a wife, you never had a daughter, you’ve never had anything but war—” The old wizard’s left hand closed hard upon Harry’s wrist, bony fin- gers digging into the still-developing muscle of Harry’s arm, and for a moment Harry was paralysed with the shock of it, he had forgotten what it meant that adults were stronger. Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice. He only turned, dragging Harry with him, and moved forward in hard steps toward the wall of the room. “Phœnix’s price.” Harry was pulled up along the black stairs. “Phœnix’s fate.” The room of black pedestals, silver light falling on shattered wands. “You think,” yelled Harry, after his lips unlocked, “that you can win any argument, just by standing here?” The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across the room. His right hand, no longer holding his wand, grabbed up a vial of silver fluid— Harry blinked in shock; the vial of silver fluid had been standing next to a picture of Dumbledore, or so it had appeared to Harry in the brief mo- ment before he was dragged past. Past the end of all the pedestals, at the farthest part of the room, rose a great stone basin with runes carved into it that Harry didn’t recognize. The centre was a shallow depression filled with transparent liquid, and into this the old wizard dumped the canister of silver fluid, which at once began to spread out, to swirl, to set the entire basin glowing eerie white. The old wizard’s hand let go of Harry’s arm and gestured to the glow- ing basin, commanding harshly, “Look!” As requested, Harry stared at the glowing water. “Put your head into the Pensieve, Harry Potter.” The old wizard’s voice was stern. Harry had heard that word before, but he couldn’t remember where . “What—does this do—” “Memories,” the old wizard said. “You will see my memory. My oath that it is safe. Now look into the Pensieve, Ravenclaw, if you still care any- thing at all for your precious truth!” That was a request that Harry could not deny, and he stepped forward and thrust his head into the glowing water. 1348 TABOO TRADE-OFFS FINAL The memory ended with a shock and Harry ripped his head out of the glowing water, gasping as though he’d been deprived of air. The transition between scenes, between decade-old reality and present moment, was another jolt to Harry’s mind; in some fashion his immersion in the past had unanchored him. The broken old man sobbing in his office had been another person in another era, Harry had understood that much; someone softer— Before it had all vanished like dissipating smoke, returning the now, the present day. Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond. “Do you also wish to see my brother as he died under the Cruciatus?” said Albus Dumbledore. “Voldemort sent me that memory too!” “And that—” Harry was having trouble producing a voice, for the grow- ing sickness in his stomach. “That was when—” The words seemed to burn in his throat, as the awful knowledge dawned on him, the horrible under- standing. “That was when you burned Narcissa Malfoy alive in her own bedroom.” Albus Dumbledore’s gaze was cold as he answered. “To that question only a fool would say yea or nay. What matters is that the Death Eaters believe I killed her, and that belief kept safe the families of all who served the Order of the Phœnix—until this day. Now do you understand what you have done? What you have done to your friends, Harry Potter, and to any that stand with you?” The old wizard seemed to grow still taller and more terrible, as his voice rose louder. “You have made them all targets, and targets they will remain! Until you prove, the only way it can be proven, that you are no longer willing to pay such prices!” “And is it true?” Harry said. There was a buzzing sensation filling him, his body growing more distant. “What Draco said, that Narcissa Malfoy never got her hands dirty, that she was only Lucius’s wife? She was an enabler, I get that, but I can’t back that deserving being burned alive.” “Nothing less would have convinced them that I was done with hesita- tion.” The old wizard’s voice brooked no question and no refusal. “Always I was too reluctant to do as I must, always it was others who paid the cost of my mercy. So Alastor told me from the beginning, but I did not listen to him. You, I expect, shall prove better at such decisions than I.” “I’m surprised,” Harry said, amazed that his voice was almost steady. “I would have expected the Death Eaters to go after another Light family and start a cycle of escalating retaliation, if you didn’t get them all with your first strike.” “If my opponent had been Lucius, perhaps.” Dumbledore’s eyes were like stones. “I am told that Voldemort laughed at the news, and pro- claimed to his Death Eaters that I had finally grown, and was at last a worthy opponent. Perhaps he was right. After the day I condemned my brother to his death, I began to weigh those who followed me, balancing them one against another, asking who I would risk, and who I would sacrifice, to what end. It was strange how many fewer pieces I lost, once I knew what they were worth.” Harry’s jaw seemed locked, like it took a massive effort to make his lips move. “But then it’s not like Lucius was deliberately taking Hermione for ransom,” Harry’s voice said thinly. “From Lucius’s perspective, someone else broke the truce first. So with that in mind, how many Galleons was Hermione worth, exactly? Leaving aside the Danegeld thing, if it was just some ordinary threat to her life, how much should I have paid to save her? Ten thousand Galleons? Five thousand?” The old wizard did not answer. “It’s a funny thing,” Harry said, his voice wavering like something seen through water. “Do you know, the day I went in front of the Dementor, what my worst memory was? It was my parents dying. I heard their voices and everything.” The old wizard’s eyes widened behind the half-moon glasses. “And here’s the thing,” Harry said, “here’s the thing I’ve been thinking about over and over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter the chance to walk away. He said that she could flee. He told her that dying in front of the crib wouldn’t save her baby. ‘Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all—’” An awful chill came over Harry as he spoke those words from his own lips, but he shook it off and continued. “And afterwards I kept thinking, I couldn’t seem to stop myself from thinking, wasn’t the Dark Lord right? If only Mother had stepped away. She tried to curse the Dark Lord but it was suicide, she had to have known that it was suicide. Her choice wasn’t between her life and mine, her choice was for herself to live or for both of us to die! If she’d only done the logical thing and walked away, I mean, I love Mum too, but Lily Potter would be alive right now and she would be my mother!” Tears were blurring Harry’s eyes. “Only now I understand, I know what Mother must have felt. She couldn’t step aside from the crib. She couldn’t! Love doesn’t walk away!” It was like the old wizard had been struck, struck by a chisel that shat- tered him straight down the middle. “What have I said?” the old wizard whispered. “What have I said to you?” “I don’t know!” shouted Harry. “I wasn’t listening either!” “I—I’m sorry, Harry—I—” The old wizard pressed his hands to his face, and Harry saw that Albus Dumbledore was weeping. “I should not have said, such things to you—I should not, have resented, your innocence—” Harry stared at the wizard for another second, and then Harry turned and marched out of the black room, down the stairs, through the office— “I really don’t know why you’re still on his shoulder,” Harry said to Fawkes. —out the oaken door and into the endlessly turning spiral. 1352 TABOO TRADE-OFFS FINAL 1353 CH APTER 82 1354 TABOO TRADE-OFFS FINAL 1355 1357 CH APTER 83 1358 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH I 1359 1361 CH APTER 84 1362 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1363 CH APTER 84 “Hermione.” When Hermione Granger opened her eyes a second time, she saw the care-lined face of Albus Dumbledore leaning over her bedside, looking almost as though he’d been crying, though that was impossible; and Her- mione felt another stabbing pang of guilt for having bothered him so. “Minerva said you wished to speak with me,” the old wizard said. “I—” Suddenly Hermione didn’t know at all what to say. Her throat locked up, and all she could do was stammer, “I—I’m—” Somehow her tone must have communicated the other word, the one she couldn’t even say any more. “Sorry?” said Dumbledore. “Why, for what should you be sorry?” She had to force the words out of her throat. “You were telling Harry— that he shouldn’t pay—so I shouldn’t—have done what Professor McGon- agall said, I shouldn’t have touched his wand—” “My dear,” said Dumbledore, “had you not pledged yourself to the House of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban single-handedly, and quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully, but I have never yet known him to lie; and in the Boy-Who-Lived there is power that the Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed have tried to break Azkaban, even at cost of his life.” The old wizard’s voice grew gen- tler, and kinder. “No, Hermione, you have nothing at all for which to blame yourself.” “I could have made him not do it.” In Dumbledore’s eyes a small twinkle appeared before it was lost to weariness. “Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps you should be Headmistress in my place, for I myself have no such power over stubborn children.” “Harry promised—” Her voice stopped. The awful truth was very hard to speak. “Harry Potter promised me—that he would never help me—if I told him not to.” There was a pause. The distant noises of the infirmary that had ac- companied Professor McGonagall had ceased, Hermione realized, when Dumbledore had awoken her. From where she lay in bed she could see only the ceiling, and the top of one wall’s windows, but nothing in her range of vision moved, and if there were sounds, she could not hear them. “Ah,” said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. “I suppose it is possible that the boy would have kept his promise.” “I should—I should’ve—” “Gone to Azkaban of your own will?” Dumbledore said. “Miss Granger, that is more than I would ever ask anyone to take upon themselves.” “But—” Hermione swallowed. She couldn’t help but notice the loop- hole, anyone who wanted to get through the portrait door to the Raven- claw dorm quickly learned to pay attention to exact wordings. “But it’s not more than you’d take on yourself.” “Hermione—” the old wizard began. “Why?” said Hermione’s voice, it seemed to be running on without her mind, now. “Why couldn’t I be braver? I was going to run in front of the Dementor—for Harry—before, I mean, in January—so why—why— why couldn’t I—” Why had the thought of being sent to Azkaban just com- pletely unglued her, why had she forgotten everything about being Good— “My dear girl,” Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind the half-moon glasses showed a complete understanding of her guilt. “I would have done no better myself, in my first year in Hogwarts. As you would be kind to others, be kinder to yourself as well.” “So I did do the wrong thing.” Somehow she needed to say that, to be told that, even though she already knew. There was a pause. “Listen, young Ravenclaw,” the old wizard said, “hear me well, for I shall speak to you a truth. Most ill-doers do not think of themselves as evil; indeed, most conceive themselves the heroes of the stories they tell. I once thought that the greatest evil in this world was done in the name of the greater good. I was wrong. Terribly wrong. There is evil in this world which knows itself for evil, and hates the good with all its strength. All fair things does it desire to destroy.” Hermione shivered in her bed, somehow it seemed very real, when Dumbledore said it. The old wizard continued speaking. “You are one of the fair things of this world, Hermione Granger, and so that evil hates you as well. If you had stayed firm through even this trial, it would have struck you harder and yet harder, until you shattered. Do not think that heroes cannot be broken! We are only more difficult to break, Hermione.” The old wizard’s eyes had grown sterner than she had ever seen. “When you have been ex- hausted for many hours, when pain and death is not a passing fear but a certainty, then it is harder to be a hero. If I must speak the truth—then today, yes, I would not waver in the face of Azkaban. But when I was a first-year in Hogwarts—I would have fled from the Dementor that you confronted, for my father had died in Azkaban, and I feared them. Know this! The evil that struck at you could have broken anyone, even myself. Only Harry Potter has it within him to face that horror, when he has come fully into his power.” Hermione’s neck couldn’t stare at the old wizard any longer; she let her head fall back, back to the pillow, where she stared up at the ceiling, absorbing what she could. “Why?” Her voice trembled again. “Why would anyone be that evil? I don’t understand.” “I, too, have wondered,” said Dumbledore’s voice, a deep sadness in it. “For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not understand. You and I will never understand, Hermione Granger. But at least I know now what true evil would say for itself, if we could speak to it and ask why it was evil. It would say, Why not?” A brief flare of indignation inside her. “There’s got to be a million rea- sons why not!” “Indeed,” said Dumbledore’s voice. “A million reasons and more. We will always know those reasons, you and I. If you insist on putting it that way—then yes, Hermione, this day’s trial broke you. But what happens af- ter you break—that, too, is part of being a hero. Which you are, Hermione Granger, and will always be.” She raised her head again, staring at him. The old wizard got up from beside her bed. His silver beard dipped down, as Dumbledore bowed to her gravely, and left. She went on looking at where the old wizard had gone. It should have meant something to her, should have touched her. Should have made her felt better inside, that Dumbledore, who had seemed so reluctant before, had now acknowledged her as a hero. She felt nothing. Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey came and made her drink something that seared her lips like the afterburn of spicy food, and smelled even hotter, and didn’t taste like anything at all. It meant nothing to her. She went on staring up at the distant stone tiles of the ceiling. 1367 CH APTER 84 1368 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1369 CH APTER 84 The holding cell, well to the centre of Magical Law Enforcement, was luxuriously appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took for granted, than any special feeling toward prisoners. There was a self- reclining, self-rocking chair with plush, richly textured, self-warming cushions. There was a bookcase containing random books rescued from a bargain bin, and a full shelf of ancient magazines, including one from 1883. As for toiletries, well, it wasn’t exactly luxurious, but there was a spell on the room which put all that business on hold; you weren’t to go anywhere that the watching Auror couldn’t see you. But aside from that, it was quite a pleasant little cell. The Defence Professor of Hogwarts was being detained, not arrested, not even intimidated. There was no evi- dence to indict him…except that a terrible and unusual crime had been committed at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and going by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the current Defence Professor was tangled up in it somehow. To this must be added the fact that nobody in the D.M.L.E. even knew who the Defence Profes- sor was, and that the man had literally sneezed at all attempts to uncover his true identity. Why, no, they hadn’t released ‘Quirinus Quirrell’ back to Hogwarts just yet. Let us repeat this for emphasis: The Defence Professor. Was being detained. In a cell. The Defence Professor was staring at the watching Auror and hum- ming. The Defence Professor has not spoken a single word since he arrived in this particular cell. He has only been humming. The humming started as a simple children’s lullaby, the one that in Muggle Britain begins, Rock-a-bye baby… This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for seven minutes, to establish the underlying pattern. Then began the elaborations upon the theme. Phrases hummed too slow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener’s mind helplessly waits and waits for the next note, the next phrase. And then, when that next phrase comes, it is so out of key, so unbelievably awfully out of key, not just out of key for the previous phrases but sung at a pitch which does not correspond to any key, that you would have to believe this person had spent hours deliberately practising their humming just to acquire such perfect anti-pitch. It bears the same resemblance to music as the awful dead voice of a Dementor bears to human speech. And this horrible, horrible humming is impossible to ignore. It is sim- ilar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that pattern unpredictably. It sets up expectations and then violates them, never in any constant pattern that would permit the humming to fade into the background. The listener’s brain cannot prevent itself from expecting the anti-musical phrases to complete, nor prevent itself from noticing the surprises. The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming came to exist is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably cruel genius who woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary torture, who decided to handicap himself and find out whether he could break someone’s sanity just by humming at them. The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful humming for four hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold, lethal presence that feels equally horrible whether he looks at it directly or lets it hover at the corner of his vision— The humming stopped. There was a long wait. Time enough for false hope to rise, and be squashed down by the memory of previous disappointments. And then, as the interval lengthened, and lengthened, that hope rose again unstoppably— The humming began once more. The Auror cracked. From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then said, “This is Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I’m calling in code RJ-L20 on cell three.” “Code RJ-L20?” the mirror said in surprised tones. There was a sound of pages being flipped, then, “You want to be relieved because a prisoner is attempting psychological warfare and succeeding?” (Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.) “What’d the prisoner say to you?” said the mirror. (This question is not part of procedure RJ-L20, but unfortunately Amelia Bones has failed to include an explicit instruction that the com- manding officer should not ask.) “He’s—” said the Auror, and glanced back at the cell. The Defence Pro- fessor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking quite relaxed. “He was staring at me! And humming!” There was a pause. The mirror spoke again. “And you’re calling in an RJ-L20 over that? You’re sure you’re not just trying to get out of watching him?” (Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.) “You don’t understand!” yelled Auror Altunay. “It’s really awful hum- ming!” The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the back- ground, sounding like it was coming from more than one person. Then speech again. “Mr Altunay, if you don’t want to be busted to Junior Auror Second Class, I suggest you buckle down and get back to work—” “Strike that,” a crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due to its distance from the mirror. (Which is why Amelia Bones often sits in on a coordination centre of the D.M.L.E. while doing her Ministry-required paperwork.) “Auror Altunay,” said the crisp voice, seeming to approach closer to the mirror, “you will be relieved shortly. Auror Ben Gutierrez, the procedure for RJ-L20 does not say that you ask why. It says that you relieve the Auror who calls it in. If I find that Aurors seem to be abusing it, I will modify the procedure to prevent its abuse—” The mirror cut off abruptly. The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current De- fence Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned chair. That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since he en- tered the cell. “Goodbye, Mr Altunay,” said the Defence Professor. A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and in walked a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes of an Auror without any sign of rank or other ornamentation, carrying a black leather folder under her left arm. “You’re relieved,” the old woman said abruptly. There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain what had been happening. This was cut short by a nod and a stark, simple finger pointing out the door. “Good evening, Madam Director,” said the Defence Professor. Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat down abruptly in the vacated chair. The old witch opened the black folder and her gaze moved down to the parchments therein. “Possible hints to the identity of the current Hogwarts Defence Professor, as compiled by Auror Robards.” The title parchment was turned, flipped aside. “The Defence Professor said that he was Sorted into Slytherin. Claimed that his family was killed by Voldemort. Said he had studied at a martial arts centre in Muggle Asia which was destroyed by Voldemort. A request filed with the Department of International Magical Cooperation identifies this incident as the Oni Affair of 1969.” Another parchment was flipped aside. “It also seems this Defence Professor gave a most stirring speech to his students, just before last Yule, castigating the previous generation for their disunity against the Death Eaters.” The old witch looked up from the leather folder. “Madam Longbottom was rather taken with it, and insisted that I read the entire thing. The argument struck me as familiar, though I could not place it at the time. But then, of course, I had thought you dead.” The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now gazing sharply at the current Defence Professor of Hogwarts, across the pane of spell-reinforced glass separating them. The man in the cell returned the gaze equably, without apparent alarm. “I shall not name any names,” said the old witch. “But I shall tell a story, and see if it sounds familiar.” Amelia Bones looked back down, turn- ing to the next parchment. “Born 1927, entered Hogwarts in 1938, sorted into Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went on a graduation tour abroad and disappeared while visiting Albania. Presumed dead until 1970, when he returned to magical Britain just as suddenly, without any explanation for the missing twenty-five years. He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in isolation. In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, he fended off an attempt by Bellatrix Black to kidnap the daughter of the Min- ister of Magic, and used the Killing Curse to slay two of the three Death Eaters accompanying her. Beyond this all Britain knows the story; need I continue it?” The old witch looked up from her folder again. “Very well. There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this young man was exonerated for his use of the Killing Curse, not least due to the efforts of his grandmother, the Lady of his House. He was reconciled with his fam- ily, and they held a House gathering to welcome his return. The guest of honour arrived at that gathering to find his entire family slain by Death Eaters, even to the house elves; and that he himself, of cadet line, was now the last remaining scion of a Most Ancient House.” The Defence Professor had not reacted at all to any of this, except that his eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness. “The young man took up his family’s seat in the Wizengamot, becom- ing among the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who. Several times he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with skilful tactics and extraordinary power. People began to speak of him as the next Dum- bledore, it was thought that he might become Minister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell. On the third of July, 1973, he failed to appear at a key Wi- zengamot vote, and was never heard from again. We assumed You-Know- Who had killed him. It was a grave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from that day on.” The old witch’s gaze was questioning. “I mourned you myself. What happened?” The Defence Professor’s shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug. “You make many assumptions,” the Defence Professor said softly. “For myself, I would believe that man died years ago. But if that man is nonetheless alive—then it is clear he does not wish the fact announced, and has rea- sons enough for silence. That man was once of some help to you, it seems.” The Defence Professor’s lips curved in a cynical smile. “But I am no longer surprised when gratitude is fleeting. Is there yet more that you would de- mand from him?” The old witch leaned back in her Auror’s monitoring-chair, looking rather startled, maybe even hurt. “No—” she said after a moment. Her fin- gers tapped the leather folder; nervously, you might have thought, if you had believed that Amelia Bones could ever be nervous. “But your House— there are not many Ancient Houses remaining—” “It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient Houses re- main, or seven.” The old witch sighed. “What does Dumbledore think of this?” The man in the detention cell shook his head. “He does not know who I am, and promised not to inquire.” The old witch’s eyebrows rose. “How did he identify you to the Hog- warts wards, then?” A slight smile. “The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts that he who stood within was the Defence Professor. Speaking of which—” The tone went lower, flatter. “I am missing my classes, Director Bones.” “You seem to—rest, sometimes, in a peculiar manner. This has also been reported. And you seem to be resting more and more frequently, as time goes on.” The old witch’s fingers tapped the leather folder again. “I cannot recall reading of such a symptom, but when one hears of such a thing, one imagines…Dark Wizards fought, and terrible curses received…” The Defence Professor remained expressionless. “Do you require a healer’s help?” said Amelia Bones. Her own mask had slipped, clearly showing the pain in her eyes. “Is there anything at all that can be done for you?” “I agreed to teach Defence at Hogwarts,” the man in the cell said flatly. “Draw your own conclusions, Madam. And I am missing my classes, of which there are not many left. I would return to Hogwarts, now.” 1376 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1377 CH APTER 84 1378 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1379 CH APTER 84 1380 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II The whole Ravenclaw dorm went silent as the two of them walked in. Staring at them. Staring at her. (She’d had nightmares like this.) And then, one by one, people looked away from her. Penelope Clearwater, the 5th-year prefect in charge of first-years, looked away slowly and deliberately, turning her head to face in another direction. Su Li and Lisa Turpin and Michael Corner, all sitting at a table to- gether, all of whom she’d helped with their homework at one time or another, all looked away, their faces suddenly nervous, the moment she tried to catch their eyes. A third-year witch named Latisha Randle, whom sphew had twice saved from Slytherin bullies, quickly bent back over her desk and started doing homework again. Mandy Brocklehurst looked away from her. If Hermione didn’t burst into tears, then, it was only because she’d expected it, had played it out in her mind over and over again. At least people weren’t screaming at her or shoving her or hexing her. They were just looking away— Hermione walked very straight up to the staircase that led toward the first-year girl’s dorms. (She didn’t see Padma Patil or Anthony Goldstein looking at her, those two lone heads turning to track her as she left.) From behind her, she heard Harry Potter saying in a very calm tone, “Now even- tually the truth’s going to come out, all of you. So if you’re all that confi- dent she’s guilty, can I ask you all to sign this paper right here, saying that if she later turns out to be innocent, she gets to say ‘I told you so’ and then hold it over you for the rest of your lives? Step on up, one and all, don’t be cowards, if you really believe you shouldn’t be afraid to bet—” She was halfway up the stairs when she realized that there would be other girls inside her dorm, too. 1382 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1383 CH APTER 84 1384 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1385 CH APTER 84 1386 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1387 CH APTER 84 1388 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH II 1389 CH APTER 84 139 0 1391 CH APTER 85 1392 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH III: DISTANCE 1393 CH APTER 85 1394 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH III: DISTANCE 1395 CH APTER 85 1396 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH III: DISTANCE 1397 CH APTER 85 1398 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH III: DISTANCE 1399 CH APTER 85 Slowly—he’d been lying there, looking at the stars, for longer than he’d planned—Harry sat up from the ground. Pushing himself to his feet, the muscles protesting, he walked over to the edge of the stone platform at the height of the Ravenclaw tower. The stone crenellations surrounding the edge of the tower weren’t high, not high enough to be safe. They were markers, clearly, rather than railings. Harry didn’t approach too close to the edge; there was no point in taking chances. Looking down at the Hogwarts grounds below, he was predictably feeling a sense of dizziness, the wobbly affliction called vertigo. His brain was alarmed, it seemed, be- cause the ground below was so distant. It might have been fully 50 metres away. The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be incredibly close before your brain could comprehend them well enough to feel fear. It was a rare brain that could feel strongly about anything, if it wasn’t close in space, close in time, near at hand, within easy reach… Before, Harry had imagined that going to Azkaban would require planning and cooperation from a grown-up confederate. Portkeys, broomsticks, invisibility spells. Some way of getting to the bottom levels without the Aurors noticing, so he could carve his way into the central pit where the shadows of Death waited. And that had been enough to put the prospect away, into the future, safely apart from the now. He hadn’t realized until today that it might be as simple as finding Fawkes and telling the phœnix that it was time. Memories were rising up again, memories that Harry could never manage to forget for long. Though the stones beneath his feet were not smooth like metal, though the moonlit sky stretched all around him, somehow it was very easy to imagine himself trapped in a long metal corridor lit by dim orange light. The night was quiet, quiet enough for memories to be clearly audible. No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die! No, I didn’t mean it, please don’t die! Don’t take it away, don’t don’t don’t— The world blurred, and Harry wiped his eyes with his sleeve. If Hermione had been the one behind that door— If Hermione had been put in Azkaban, Harry would have called the phœnix and gone there and burned away every last Dementor and it wouldn’t have made a single difference how crazy it was or what else he’d wanted to do with his life. That was just—that was—that was just how it was. And the woman who was behind that door—wasn’t there someone, somewhere, to whom she too was precious? Wasn’t it only Harry’s dis- tance from her life that was preventing his brain from being driven to Azk- aban to save her no matter what? What would it have taken to compel him? Would he have needed to know her face? Her name? Her favourite colour? Would he have been driven to Azkaban to save Tracey Davis? Would he have been compelled there to save Professor McGonagall? Mum and Dad— there wasn’t even any question. And that woman had said she was some- one’s mother. How many people had wished for the power to break Azka- ban? How many prisoners of Azkaban dreamed nightly of such a miracu- lous rescue? None. It’s a happy thought. Maybe he should harrow Azkaban. All he had to do was find Fawkes and tell him it was time. Visualize the centre of the Dementor’s pit as he’d seen it from the broomstick, and let the phœnix take him there. Cast the True Patronus Charm at point-blank range and to hell with what came after. All he had to do was go find Fawkes. It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the fire-bird in his heart— A star flashed in the night. By the time Harry’s eyes had jumped with a reflex action trained on meteor showers, another part of him was surprised that the astronomical phenomenon was still there; a faint star whose brightness was slowly visi- bly waxing. There was a startled moment when Harry wondered whether he was seeing, not a meteor, but a nova or supernova—could you see them getting brighter like that? Was the first stage of a nova supposed to be that yellow-orange colour? Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as bright- ening. It looked closer suddenly, no longer so far away that distance be- came moot. Like what you thought was a star, turning out to be an æro- plane, a lighted form whose shape you could actually see… …no, not a plane… The realization seemed to spread out from Harry’s chest in a wave of prickling, sweat preparing to break out. …a bird. A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of Hogwarts. The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding golden flames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings beat and beat again. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to hover a few paces away from Harry, even as the flames surrounding its passage diminished, the creature seemed no dimmer, no less bright; as though some unseen Sun shone upon it and illuminated it. Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like incandescent pearls, blazing with golden fire and determination. The phœnix’s beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry under- stood as though it had been a spoken word: COME! Not even realizing, the boy stumbled back from the edge of the rooftop, eyes still locked on the phœnix, his whole body trembling and tensed, his fists clutching and releasing at his side; stepping back, stepping away. The phœnix cawed again, a desperate, pleading, sound. It didn’t come through in words, this time, but it came through in feelings, an echo of ev- erything that Harry had ever felt about Azkaban and every temptation to action, to just do something about it, the desperate need to do something now and not delay any longer, all spoken in the cry of a bird. Let’s go. It’s time. The voice that spoke came from inside Harry, not from the phœnix; from so deep inside it couldn’t be given a separate name like ‘Gryffindor’. All he had to do was step forward and touch the phœnix’s talons, and it would take him where he needed to be, where he kept thinking he ought to be, down into the central pit of Azkaban. Harry could see the image in his mind, shining with unbearable clarity, the image of himself suddenly smiling with joyous release as he threw all his fears away and chose— “But I—” Harry whispered, not even aware of what he was saying. Harry lifted his shaking hands to wipe at his eyes from which tears had sprung, as the phœnix hovered before him with great wing-sweeps. “But I—there’s other people I also have to save, other things I have to do—” The fire-bird let out a piercing scream, and the boy flinched back as though from a blow. It wasn’t a command, it wasn’t an objection, it was the knowledge— The corridors lit by dim orange light. It felt like a tightening compulsion in Harry’s chest, the desire to just do it and get it over with. He might die, but if he didn’t die he could feel clean again. Have principles that were more than excuses for inaction. It was his life. His to spend, if he chose. He could do it any time he wanted… …if he wasn’t a good person. 1403 CH APTER 85 1404 TABOO TRADE-OFFS, AFTERMATH III: DISTANCE 1405 CH APTER 85 Final Aftermath She came awake with a gasp of horror, she woke with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no words came forth, she could not understand what she had seen, she could not understand what she had seen— “What time is it?” she whispered. Her golden jewelled alarm clock whispered back, “Around eleven at night. Go back to sleep.” Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up before she tried to go back to sleep and eventually succeeded. Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep. In the Forbidden Forest, a centaur woken by a nameless apprehension ceased scanning the night sky, having found only questions there and no answers; and with a folding of his many legs, Firenze went back to sleep. In the distant lands of magical Asia, an ancient witch named Fan Tong, sleeping the tired days away, told her anxious great-great-grandson that she was fine, it had only been a nightmare, and went back to sleep. In a land where Muggle-borns received no letters of any kind, a girl- child too young to have a name of her own was rocked in the arms of her annoyed but loving mother until she stopped crying and went back to sleep. None of them slept well.

Minerva didn’t particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she inherited that desk some day—if any of them survived. Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and composed. Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes, hov- ering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused him of pretending to be. Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to arrive. And Harry… A boy’s small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as though the energies running through him were too great to allow ordinary seat- ing. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and within it all, the jagged lightning bolt of his livid scar. He seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier. For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley with Harry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There’d been this sombre boy inside that Harry, somehow, even then. This wasn’t entirely her own fault, or Albus’s fault. And yet there was something almost unbearably sad about the contrast between the young boy she’d first met, and what mag- ical Britain had made of him. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she’d gathered; Harry’s adoptive parents had said to her that he’d spoken little and played less with Muggle children. It was painful to think that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside the other children in Hogwarts, before the war’s demands had stripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry showed to the children his own age, when he wasn’t staring down the Wizengamot. But she couldn’t stop herself from imagining Harry Potter’s childhood as a heap of fire- wood, and herself and Albus feeding the wooden branches, piece by piece, into the flames. “Prophecies are strange things,” said Albus Dumbledore. The old wizard’s eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. “Vague, unclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers. Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only questions.” Harry Potter was sitting tensely. “Headmaster Dumbledore,” said the boy with soft precision, “my friends are being targeted. Hermione Gran- ger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you put it. Professor Trelawney’s prophecy is key information for weighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what’s going on. Not to mention how silly it is—and dangerous—that the Dark Lord knows the prophecy and I don’t.” Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in reply; in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that Trelawney had made the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it, he hadn’t learned that much from her. “Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his defeat at your hands,” the old wizard said then. “His knowledge brought him only harm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter.” “Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has a literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted prophecies. I’ll in- terpret with caution, rest assured. But I’ve already guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me to work from partial guesses?” Time passed. “Minerva,” said Albus. “If you would.” “The one…” she began. The words came falteringly to her throat; she was no actress. She couldn’t imitate the deep, chilling tone of the origi- nal prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to carry all the meaning. “The one with power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches…born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…” “And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,” came Severus’s voice, making her jump within her chair. The Potions Master loomed tall by the fireplace. “But he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not…and either must destroy all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world.” That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it chilled her bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill Trelawney. Harry was listening with a frown. “Can you repeat that?” said Harry. “The one with power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month—” “Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyse this care- fully—” This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the parchment hawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand reached in and snatched the precious information away. “Let’s see…” Harry said. “I’m male and born on July 31st, check. I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous pronoun in line two…but I wasn’t born yet so it’s hard to see how my parents could have thrice de- fied me. This scar is an obvious candidate for the mark…” Harry touched his forehead. “Then there’s the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably refers to my scientific background—” “No,” said Severus. Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise. Severus’s eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration. “The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books as you, Potter. But the prophecy did not say, power the Dark Lord has not. Nor even, power the Dark Lord cannot have. She spoke of power the Dark Lord knows not… it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts. Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seen it…” “Science is not a bag of technological tricks,” Harry said. “It’s not just the Muggle version of a wand. It’s not even knowledge like memorizing the periodic table. It’s a different way of thinking.” “Perhaps…” the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was skeptical. “It is hazardous,” Albus said, “to read too far into a prophecy, even if you have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding frustration.” “So I see,” Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his fore- head. “But…okay, if this is really all we know…look, I’ll just put it bluntly. How do you know that the Dark Lord actually survived?” “What?” she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back in the vast Head- master’s chair. “Well,” Harry said, “imagine how this prophecy sounded back when it was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like I’m destined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are meant to have a final battle where either of us must destroy all but a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric’s Hollow and immedi- ately gets vanquished, leaving behind some remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul. Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This prophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I’m saying. Don’t get me wrong—I do realize that my interpretation sounds stretched. Trelawney’s phrasing doesn’t seem natural for describing only the events that historically happened on October 31st, 1981. Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn’t something you’d normally call ‘the power to vanquish’. But if you think of the prophecy as being about several possible futures, only one of which was actually realized on Halloween, then the prophecy could already be complete.” “But—” Minerva blurted. “But the raid on Azkaban—” “If the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he’s the most likely suspect for the Azkaban breakout,” Harry said reasonably. “You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence for the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more likely to happen in worlds where he’s alive than worlds where he’s dead. But it’s not strong Bayesian evi- dence. It’s not something that can’t possibly happen unless the Dark Lord is alive. Professor Quirrell, who didn’t start from the assumption that You- Know-Who was still around, had no trouble thinking of his own explana- tion. To him, it was obvious that some powerful wizard might want Bel- latrix Black because she knew a secret of the Dark Lord’s, like some of his magical knowledge that he’d told only her. The priors against anyone sur- viving their body’s death are very low, even if it’s magically possible. Most times it doesn’t happen. So if it’s just the Azkaban breakout…I’d have to say formally that it isn’t enough Bayesian evidence. The improbability of the evidence assuming that the hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the prior improbability of the hypothesis.” “No,” Severus said flatly. “The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I would know if it were.” “Are you sure of that?” “Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would understand it! I heard Trelawney’s words, I remember Trelawney’s voice, and if I knew the events that matched the prophecy, I would recognize them. What has already happened…does not fit.” The Potions Master spoke with certainty. “I’m not really sure what to do with that statement,” Harry said. His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. “Maybe it’s just what you think happened that doesn’t fit, and the true history is different…” “Voldemort is alive,” Albus said. “There are other indications.” “Such as?” Harry’s reply was instant. Albus paused. “There are terrible rituals by which wizards have re- turned from death,” Albus said slowly. “That much, anyone can discern within history and legend. And yet those books are missing, I could not find them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure—” “So you can’t find any books on immortality, and that proves that You- Know-Who has them?” “Indeed,” said Albus. “There is a certain book—I will not name it aloud—missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library. An ancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and Burkes, with only an empty place on a shelf to show where it was—” The old wizard stopped. “But I suppose,” the old wizard said, as though to himself, “you will say that even if Voldemort tried to make himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded…” Harry sighed. “Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever probabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality rituals which are missing, that increases the probability that someone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises the prior probability of the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and thank you for contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior probability goes up enough.” “Surely,” Albus said quietly, “if you concede even a chance that Volde- mort survived, that is worth guarding against?” Harry inclined his head. “As you say, Headmaster. Though once a probability drops low enough, it’s also an error to go on obsessing about it…Given that books on immortality are missing, and that this prophecy would sound somewhat more natural if it refers to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle, I agree that the Dark Lord being alive is a proba- bility, not just possibility. But other probabilities must also be taken into account—and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is not alive, someone else framed Hermione.” “Foolishness,” Severus said softly. “Utter foolishness. The Dark Mark has not faded, nor has its master.” “See, that’s what I mean by formally insufficient Bayesian evidence. Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and stuff, but is it that unlikely for a magical mark to stay around after the maker dies? Suppose the mark is certain to continue while the Dark Lord’s sentience lives on, but a priori we’d only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the Dark Mark continu- ing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the observation, ‘The Dark Mark has not faded’ is five times as likely to occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where the Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensu- rate with the prior improbability of immortality? Let’s say the prior odds were a hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus false, you should up- date to believing the hypothesis is twenty times as likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one, times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to one that the Dark Lord is dead—” “Where are you getting all these numbers, Potter?” “That is the admitted weakness of the method,” Harry said readily. “But what I’m qualitatively getting at is why the observation, ‘The Dark Mark has not faded’, is not adequate support for the hypothesis, ‘The Dark Lord is immortal.’ The evidence isn’t as extraordinary as the claim.” Harry paused. “Not to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn’t have to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man once said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one plan.” “Such as the Defence Professor,” Severus said with a thin smile. “I sup- pose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defence Professor last year, after all; and the year before that, and the year before that.” Harry’s eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. “Let’s move on. Are we certain that this Prophecy is accurate? Nobody messed with Professor McGonagall’s memory, maybe edited or subtracted a line?” Albus paused, then spoke slowly. “There is a great spell laid over Britain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far be- neath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department of Mysteries, they are recorded.” “The Hall of Prophecy,” Minerva whispered. She’d read about that place, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs, one after another appearing over the years. Merlin himself had wrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard’s final slap to the face of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin had wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to know what had been spoken of them. That was the respect Merlin had given to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from the outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would have a glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the prophet’s true voice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it was said, would be driven mad—or possibly just have their heads explode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin’s original intention, the Unspeakables hadn’t let anyone enter in centuries, so far as she’d heard. Works of the Ancient Wizards had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that tipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers releasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and so the heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to wonder (now that she’d spent a few months around Mr Potter) how anyone could possibly know that; but she also knew better than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her. Minerva firmly believed that you only ought to worry about Time if you were a clock. “The Hall of Prophecy,” Albus confirmed quietly. “Those who are spo- ken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you see the implication, Harry?” Harry frowned. “Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord…oh, my parents. Those who had thrice defied him. They were also mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the recording?” “If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva re- ported,” Albus said evenly, “they did not say so to me.” “You took James and Lily there?” Minerva said. “Fawkes can go to many places,” Albus said. “Do not mention the fact.” Harry was staring directly at Albus. “Can I go to this Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I’ve heard.” Light glinted from the reflection of Albus’s half-moon glasses as the old wizard slowly shook his head. “I think that would be unwise,” Albus said. “For reasons beyond the obvious. It is dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some people than others.” “I see,” Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the parchment. “I’ll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The next part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any ideas on what that means exactly?” “Surely not,” said Albus, “that you must imitate his ways, in any wise.” “I’m not dumb, Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a thing or two about temporal paradoxes, even if it’s all theoretical to them. I won’t throw away my ethics just because a signal from the future claims it’s going to happen, because then that becomes the only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what does it mean?” “I do not know,” said Severus. “Nor I,” she said. Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing medita- tively at the wood. “Eleven inches, holly, with a core of phœnix feather,” Harry said. “And the phœnix whose tail feather is in this wand, only ever gave one other, which Mr…what was his name, Olive-something…made into the core of the Dark Lord’s wand. And I’m a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of coincidence even then. And now I find out there’s a prophecy stating that I’ll be the Dark Lord’s equal.” Severus’s eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster’s gaze, unreadable. “Could it be,” Minerva said falteringly, “that You-Know-Who—that Voldemort—transferred some of his own powers to Mr Potter, the night he gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do, surely. Still…I don’t see how Mr Potter could be his equal, if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord himself…” “Meh,” said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. “I’d fight the Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. Homo sapiens didn’t become the dominant species on this planet by having the sharpest claws or hard- est armour—though I suppose some of that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it’s beneath my dignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn’t smarter than I am; and from what I’ve heard, on that particular dimension the Dark Lord wasn’t very scary.” The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his custom- ary contemptuous drawl. “You imagine yourself more intelligent than the Dark Lord, Potter?” “Yes, in fact,” said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his robes, and rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare elbow. “Oh, that re- minds me! Let’s make sure nobody here has the clearly visible tattoo in the standard, easily checkable location which would mark them as a secret enemy spy.” Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master before he could say anything scathing. “Tell me, Harry,” Albus said, “how would you have crafted the Dark Mark?” “Non-standard locations,” Harry said promptly, “not easily found without embarrassment and fuss, though of course any security-con- scious person would check anyway. Make it smaller, if possible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo to obscure the exact shape—better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin—” “Cunning indeed,” Albus said. “But tell me, suppose you could craft any conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising it as you wished. What would you do then?” “Make it completely invisible at all times,” Harry said in tones of stat- ing the obvious. “You don’t want there to be any detectable difference between a spy and a non-spy.” “Suppose you are more cunning still,” Albus said. “You are a master of trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your abilities to the fullest.” “Well—” The boy stopped, frowning. “It seems unnecessarily compli- cated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a role-playing game than something you’d try in a real-life war. But I suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people who aren’t really Death Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death Eaters invisible. But then there’s the question of why people would start believing in the first place that the Dark Mark iden- tified a Death Eater…I’d have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I were going to take the problem seriously.” “I ask you this,” Albus said, still in that mild tone, “because I did in- deed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as you suggested. The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did not trust in the bare arms we saw. I had thought, afterwards, that the bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it at their will. And yet when we hauled Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark showed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest his innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not know. Even Severus is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its secrets to any who do not know them.” “Oh, well that makes it obvious,” Harry said promptly. “Wait, hold on— you were a Death Eater?” Harry transferred his stare to Severus. Severus returned a thin smile. “I still am, so far as they know.” “Harry,” said Albus, eyes only for the boy. “What do you mean, that makes it obvious?” “Information theory 101,” the boy said in a lecturing tone. “Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and only if the pos- sible values of X have different probabilities given different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything whatsoever that varies between a spy and a non-spy, you should immediately think of exploiting it to dis- tinguish spies from non-spies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and falsehood—that’s why ‘faith’ doesn’t work as a discriminant, while ‘make experimental predictions and test them’ does. You say someone with the Dark Mark can’t reveal its secrets to anyone who doesn’t already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark operates, write down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark might work, then watch Professor Snape try to tell each of those things to a confederate—maybe one who doesn’t know what the experiment is about—I’ll explain binary search later so that you can play Twenty Questions to narrow things down—and what- ever he can’t say out loud is true. His silence would be something that behaves differently in the presence of true statements about the Mark, versus false statements, you see.” Minerva’s mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed it abruptly. Even Albus looked surprised. “And after that, like I said, any behavioural difference between spies and non-spies can be used to identify spies. Once you’ve identified at least one magically censored secret of the Dark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark Mark by seeing if they can reveal that secret to somebody who doesn’t already know it—” “Thank you, Mr Potter.” Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was straightening, his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph. “Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark. If we know we are caught for a Death Eater, be- fore others who have not yet seen our bare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But if they have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself; nor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark seems to identify Death Eaters—but only those already found, you perceive.” “Ah…” Albus said. “Thank you, Severus.” He closed his eyes briefly. “That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter’s notice…ah, well. And Harry’s proposed test?” The Potions Master shook his head. “The Dark Lord was no fool, de- spite Potter’s delusions. The moment such a test is suspected, the Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the possibility, but only wait for another to deduce it.” Another thin smile. “I would award you a good many House points, Mr Potter, if it would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord was quite cunning.” His gaze grew more distant. “Oh,” Severus breathed, “he was very cunning indeed…” Harry Potter sat still for a long moment. Then— “No,” Harry said. The boy shook his head. “No, that can’t actually be true. First of all, we’re talking about the kind of logic puzzle that would appear in chapter one of a Raymond Smullyan book, nowhere near the level of what Muggle scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know, it took the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I just solved in five seconds—” “Is it that inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone could be so intel- ligent as yourself?” The Potions Master’s voice held more curiosity than scorn. “It’s called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is equally com- patible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over the course of five months or over the course of five seconds, but in any given population there’ll be many more people who can do it in five months than in five seconds…” Harry pasted a hand against his forehead. “Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from your perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I cleverly solved it and that makes us look equal.” “I remember your first day of Potions class,” the Potions Master said dryly. “I think you have some way still to go.” “Peace, Severus,” Albus said. “Harry has already accomplished more than you know. Yet tell me, Harry—why do you believe the Dark Lord is less than you? Surely he is a damaged soul in many ways. But cunning for cunning—you are not yet ready to face him, I would judge; and I know the full tally of your deeds.” 1423 CH APTER 86 1424 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1425 CH APTER 86 1426 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1427 CH APTER 86 1428 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING Hypothesis: Hermione Granger (April 8th, 1992, 6:53 p.m.) Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who didn’t have secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their dinner around four huge tables— “It’s funny,” Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. “I didn’t believe the Gen- eral when he said that what we learned would change us forever, and we’d never be able to return to a normal life afterwards. Once we knew. Once we saw what he could see.” “I know!” said Seamus Finnigan. “I thought it was just a joke too! Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said ever.” “But now—” Dean said sadly. “We can’t go back, can we? It’d be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to Hogwarts. We’ve just… we’ve just got to stay around each other. That’s all we can do, or we’ll go crazy.” Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate an- other bite of veldbeest. Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued. It wasn’t as relentless as it’d been yesterday, but now and then the topic wan- dered back. “Well, there must’ve been some sort of love triangle,” said a second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered when asked if there was any relation). “The question is, which ways was it going before it all went wrong? Who was in love with who—and whether or not that person loved them back—I don’t know how many possibilities there are—” “Sixty-four,” said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who probably should’ve been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff instead. “No, wait, that’s wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy and Malfoy didn’t love any- one then he wouldn’t really be part of the love triangle…this is going to take Arithmancy, could you all wait two minutes?” “I, for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is Potter’s moirail, and that Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy and Granger.” The witch who’d spoken nodded with the self-satisfaction of someone who has just precisely nailed down a complicated issue. “Those aren’t even words,” objected a young wizard. “You’re just mak- ing them up as you go.” “Sometimes you can’t describe a thing using real words.” “It’s so sad,” said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had tears in her eyes. “They were just—they were just so obviously meant to be together!” “You mean Potter and Malfoy?” said a second-year named Colleen Johnson. “I know—their families hated each other so much, there’s no way they couldn’t fall in love—” “No, I mean all three of them,” said Sherice. This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean Thomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any sounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his shirt. “Wow,” said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy Hua. “That’s really…sophisticated of you, Sherice.” “Look, all of you, we need to keep this realistic,” said Eloise Rosen, a tall witch who’d been General of an army and hence spoke with an air of authority. “We know—because she kissed him—that Granger was in love with Potter. So the only reason she’d try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was losing Potter to him. There’s no need to make it all sound so complicated—you’re all acting like this is a play instead of real life!” “But even if Granger was in love, it’s still funny that she’d just snap like that,” said Chloe, whose black robes combined with her night-black skin to make her look like a darkened silhouette. “I don’t know…I think maybe there’s more to this than just a romance novel gone wrong. I think maybe most people haven’t got any idea at all what’s going on.” “Yes! Thank you!” burst out Dean Thomas. “Look—don’t you realize— like Harry Potter told us all—if you didn’t predict that something would happen, if it took you completely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when you didn’t see it coming, isn’t enough to ex- plain…” Dean’s voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening. “It’s completely hopeless, isn’t it?” “You hadn’t figured that out yet?” said Lavender Brown, who was sit- ting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics. “How’d you ever make Lieutenant?” “Oh, you two be quiet!” Sherice snapped at them. “It’s obvious you both want the three of them for yourselves!” “I mean it!” Chloe said. “What if what’s really going on is different from all the, you know, normal things that all the ordinary people are talk- ing about? What if somebody—made Granger do what she did, just like Potter was trying to tell everyone?” “I think Chloe’s right,” said a foreign-looking boy wizard who always introduced himself as ‘Adrian Turnipseed’, though his parents had ac- tually named him Mad Drongo. “I think this whole time there’s been…” Adrian lowered his voice ominously, “…a hidden hand…” Adrian raised his voice again, “shaping all that’s happened. One person who’s been be- hind everything, from the beginning. And I don’t mean Professor Snape, either.” “You don’t mean—” gasped Sarah. “Yes,” Adrian said. “The real one behind it all is—Tracey Davis!” “That’s what I think too,” Chloe said. “After all—” She glanced around rapidly. “Ever since that thing with the bullies and the ceiling—even the trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like they’re shaking, like they’re afraid—” Seamus Finnigan was frowning thoughtfully. “I think I see where Harry gets his…you know…from,” Seamus said, lowering his voice so that only Lavender and Dean could hear. “Oh, I totally know what you mean,” Lavender said. She didn’t bother to lower her own voice. “It’s a wonder he didn’t crack and just start killing everyone ages ago.” “Personally,” Dean said, also in a quieter voice, “I’d say the really scary part is—that could’ve been us.” “Yeah,” said Lavender. “It’s a good thing we’re all perfectly sane now.” Dean and Seamus nodded solemnly. 1432 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1433 CH APTER 86 1434 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1435 CH APTER 86 1436 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1437 CH APTER 86 Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed with cotton wool. Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster’s office, the Floo-Fire dimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk. “Hello, Harry,” the Headmaster said quietly. “I didn’t even see him move,” Harry marvelled, muscles creaking as he sat up. “You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody,” said Dum- bledore, “and you took your eye off his wand.” Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his pouch. “I mean—I was taking the duelling stance so that he’d think I was a standard idiot and underestimate me—but I have to admit, that was impressive.” “So you planned it all along, Harry?” Dumbledore said. “Of course,” Harry said. “Note how I’m doing this as soon as I wake up, rather than pausing to think of it.” Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back up at the wall clock he’d surreptitiously glanced at earlier. It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and now it was five minutes after nine. “Hello again, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I cannot believe that guy’s reaction time,” Harry said, brushing off his Cloak as he stood up from where he’d been lying invisible on the floor, unseen by his previous self. “I can’t believe his movement speed either. I’m going to have to figure out some way to zap him without speaking an incantation that gives it away…” “Hello again, Harry.” “Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your stairs, and then come back up again, before I make the final jump backward? This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation—” 1440 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING “So you went to Flitwick, then,” Moody said. The retired Auror was now sitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a restorative in a bot- tle he’d taken off his belt. Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of perched on an armrest. “I tried the Defence Professor first, but—” The boy gri- maced. “He…wasn’t available. Well, I’d decided it was worth risking five House points, and if you say a risk is worth it, you can’t complain when you have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that if you had an eye that saw things other people couldn’t see, then as Isaac Asimov pointed out in Second Foun- dation, the weapon to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction, you know, and you’ll read everything at least once. Anyway, I told Profes- sor Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge number of shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole office, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no idea what it would even mean to cast an illusion and then make it invisible, but I figured if I didn’t mention that out loud, Professor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out there was no spell like that I could cast myself, but Flitwick Charmed me a one-time device for it—though I had to persuade him that it wasn’t cheat- ing, since nothing could possibly be cheating against an Auror who’d lived long enough to retire. And then I still didn’t see how I could hit you, when you were moving that fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when Flitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving Stunner. It’s one of Professor Flitwick’s own inventions—he’s a champion duellist as well as a Charms Master—” “I know that, son.” “Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit before he got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a finishing move on an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to the target as possible along its original trajectory, and then once it detects that the target is getting more distant again, the hex turns in mid-air and heads straight for the target. It can only swerve once—but the incantation sounds very close to ‘Stupefy’ and the hex is the same red colour, so if the enemy thinks it’s a regular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that mid-air retargeting will finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested that none of us talk about his special move, just in case he does get a chance to use it during competition some day.” “But—” said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody, who was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his face decidedly blank. “Mr Potter, you just stunned Mad-Eye Moody! The most famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of the Auror Office! That should’ve been impossible!” Moody let out a dark chuckle. “What’s your answer to that one, kid? I’m curious.” “Well…” Harry said. “First of all, Professor McGonagall, neither of us was fighting seriously.” “Neither of you?” “Of course,” Harry said. “In a serious fight, Mr Moody would’ve dropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to attack. And on my side, if it was actually necessary to take down the most famous Auror in the history of the office, I’d get Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And beyond that…since that wasn’t a real fight…” Harry paused. “How can I put this? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth with spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a small room and fire bullets at each other…then whoever hits first, wins. And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots, giving the other person one chance after another—like Mr Moody gave me one chance after another—well, you’d have to be pretty pathetic to lose.” “Oh, not that pathetic,” Moody said with a slightly threatening grin. Harry didn’t seem to notice. “You might say that Mr Moody was test- ing me to see if I would try to fight him, or try to win. That is, whether I’d carry out the role of somebody fighting—use standard spells I already knew, even though I didn’t expect the consequences of that action to be victory—or if I’d search through unusual plans until I found something that could win. Like the difference between a student who sits in class be- cause that’s what students do, versus a student who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes to actually learn a piece of material, and prac- tises however necessary—you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look at it that way—realize that Mr Moody was giving me chances, and that I shouldn’t attack in the first place unless I think I can win—then I don’t come out looking so well, since it actually took me three tries to get him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr Moody could’ve turned himself invisible, or put up shields—” “Don’t go relying too much on shields, boy,” Mad-Eye said. The leather- clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask. “What you learn in your first year at the academy doesn’t stay true forever, not against the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever made, there’s some curse that goes straight through it, if you’re not quick enough to cast the counter. And there’s one curse that goes through everything, and it’s a curse any Death Eater will use.” Harry Potter nodded gravely. “Right, some spells are impossible to block. I’ll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing Curse at me. Again.” “That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don’t you forget it.” A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. “I know. Sorry.” “So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go after Lockhart?” Harry opened his mouth, then paused. “I won’t tell you how to run a war,” the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. “I don’t have any experience at that. All I know is that there are consequences. Please be advised that my own assessment is that Lockhart is probably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too much risk—” The boy shrugged. “I don’t know the cost. Just please, if you can, be careful not to hurt him if he’s innocent.” “If I can,” said Moody. “And—you’re aiming to look through his mind for evidence about the Dark Lord, aren’t you? I don’t know what the rules are in magical Britain about admissible evidence—but everyone’s always guilty of breaking some law or another, there’s just too many laws. So if it’s not about the Dark Lord, don’t turn him in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?” Moody frowned. “Son, nobody gains power that fast without being up to something.” “Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find evidence the ordinary way. Please, Mr Moody. Call it a quirk of my Muggle upbring- ing, but if it’s not about the war I don’t want us to be the evil police who break into people’s houses in the middle of the night, rummage through their minds and send them off to Azkaban.” “I don’t see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you the favour.” “Is there aught else, Alastor?” inquired Albus. “Yes,” said Moody. “About that Defence Professor of yours—” Hypothesis: Dumbledore (April 9th, 1992, 5:32 p.m.) As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup jerked in mid- air, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely slopping over the side, so that only three single drops crawled down the side of the teacup. Harry would have missed it, if he hadn’t happened to be watching closely; for Professor Quirrell’s hand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after. If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it would be the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defence Professor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much that would actually handi- cap Professor Quirrell, if at all, Harry couldn’t guess. The Defence Profes- sor was certainly capable of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for larger things—but for him that might only be a convenience… “Insanity,” said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from his tea—he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was unusual for him—“can be a signature all its own.” The Defence Professor’s small office was silent, the sound-warded room quiet in a way the Headmaster’s office never could be. Sometimes the two of them both happened to finish exhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an auditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself. “I’ll agree with that in one sense,” Harry said. “If somebody tells me that everyone is staring at them and that their underwear is being dusted with thought-controlling powder, I know they’re psychotic, because that’s the standard signature of psychosis. But if you tell me that any- thing confusing points to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems… overreaching. Just because I can’t see a purpose doesn’t mean there is no purpose.” “Purposeless?” said Professor Quirrell. “Oh, but the madness of Dum- bledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many purposes. The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius Malfoy throw away his game for vengeance on you—or it might be a dozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has reason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange things already?” Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor Quir- rell would know what it meant. He’d considered bringing his own can of soda—but had decided against that as well, after realizing how easy it would be for the Defence Professor to teleport in a bit of potion, even if the two of them couldn’t touch each other with direct magic. “I have seen a little now of Dumbledore,” Harry said. “Unless every- thing I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe that he would plot to send any Hogwarts student to Azkaban. Ever.” “Ah,” the Defence Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of the teacup gleaming in his pale eyes. “But perhaps that is another signature, Mr Pot- ter. You have not yet comprehended the perspective of a man like Dum- bledore. If he must, in some sufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student— why, who would he choose, but she who declared herself a heroine?” That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but that did seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses’ probability mass onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly, Professor Quirrell had predicted in advance that Dumbledore might target Draco… But if it’s you behind all of this, Professor, you might have shaped your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to cast suspicion on him in advance. The concept of ‘evidence’ had something of a different meaning, when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to play the game at ‘one level higher than you’. “I see your point, Professor,” Harry said evenly, giving no hint of his other thoughts. “So you think it most probable that it was the Headmaster who framed Hermione?” “Not necessarily, Mr Potter.” Professor Quirrell drained his teacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp rap as it de- scended. “There is also Severus Snape—though what he might think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my prime suspect either.” “Then who is?” Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell surely wasn’t about to reply ‘You-Know-Who’— “The Aurors have a rule,” said Professor Quirrell. “Investigate the vic- tim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the apparent vic- tims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many criminals imagine it, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a dozen times over.” “You’re not seriously trying to convince me that Hermione—” The Defence Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed looks that meant he was being stupid. Draco? Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum—but Lucius might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to…oh. “You think Lucius Malfoy set up his own son?” Harry said. “Why not?” Professor Quirrell said softly. “From Mr Malfoy’s recorded testimony, Mr Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some success in changing Mr Malfoy’s political views. If Lucius Malfoy learned of that earlier…he might have decided that his former heir had become a liability.” “I don’t buy it,” Harry said flatly. “You are being wantonly naive, Mr Potter. The history books are full of family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and threats far less than those which Mr Malfoy posed to his father. I suppose next you will tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters is far too gentle to wish his son such harm.” A tinge of heavy sarcasm. “Well, yes, frankly,” Harry said. “Love is real, Professor, a phe- nomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are real, and love is as much a part of the real world as apples and trees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental love into ac- count, you’d have a heck of a time explaining why my own parents didn’t abandon me at an orphanage after the Incident with the Science Project.” The Defence Professor did not react to this at all. Harry continued. “From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him over important Wizengamot votes. That’s significant evidence, since there’s less expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake it. And it’s not like the prior probability of a parent loving their child is low. I suppose it’s possible that Lucius was just taking on the role of a loving father, and he renounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with Muggle- borns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must distinguish possibility from probability.” “All the better the crime,” the Defence Professor said, still in that soft tone, “if no-one would believe it of him.” “And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first place, without setting off the wards? He’s not a Professor—oh, right, you think it’s Professor Snape.” “Wrong,” said the Defence Professor. “Lucius Malfoy would trust no servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor, intel- ligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no great fight- ing ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth—he would go in person, for this—and speaks to her a single word.” “Imperio.” “Legilimens, rather,” said Professor Quirrell. “I do not know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning Professor under the Im- perius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy probably does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at least; he might be able to use Legili- mency. And for the target…perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy Professor moving about at night.” “Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout,” said Harry. “Since she’s the last person anyone would suspect.” The Defence Professor hesitated minutely. “Perhaps.” “Actually,” Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his face, “I don’t suppose you know offhand if any of the current Professors at Hog- warts were around back when Mr Hagrid got framed in 1943?” “Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical Creatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy,” Professor Quirrell said at once. “And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr Potter, there is no reason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in that affair.” Harry shrugged artfully. “Seemed worth asking the question, just to check. Anyway, Professor, I agree it’s possible that some outsider Legilim- ized a member of Hogwarts staff—and then Obliviated them afterwards, there’s no way anyone would forget that part. But I don’t think Lucius Mal- foy is a probable candidate for the mastermind. It’s possible but not prob- able that all of Lucius’s apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty, and that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It’s possible though not proba- ble that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot was just an act. People’s outsides do not always resemble their insides, like you said. But there’s one piece of evidence that doesn’t fit at all.” “And that would be?” said the Defence Professor, his eyes half-lidded. “Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for Hermione’s life. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when Lucius said he was refusing it despite the rules of honour. The Wizengamot didn’t expect that of him. Why wouldn’t he just take the money while acting all indignant and pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn’t actually care that much about throwing Hermione into Azkaban.” There was a pause. “Perhaps the role he was playing ran away with him,” said Professor Quirrell. “It does happen, Mr Potter, in the heat of the moment.” “Perhaps,” Harry said. “But it’s still one more improbability to be postulated—and by the time you have to add up that many excuses in a theory, it can’t be at the top of the list any more. Anything else in par- ticular you think I ought to think about, within the range of all other possibilities?” There was a long silence. The Defence Professor’s eyes dropped down to look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually distant. “I suppose I can think of one final suspect,” the Defence Professor said at last. Harry nodded. The Defence Professor didn’t seem to notice, but only spoke on. “Has the Headmaster told you anything—even a hint—about Professor Trelawney’s prophecy?” “Huh?” Harry said automatically, converting his own sudden shock into the best dissembling he could manage. It probably was at the wrong level to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry certainly couldn’t take time to think before replying—wait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell know about that— “Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?” “You were there to hear its beginning,” Professor Quirrell said, frown- ing. “You called out to the entire school that the prophecy could not be about you, since you were not coming here, you were already here.” He is coming. The one who will tear apart the very— And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had got before Dumbledore had grabbed her and vanished. “Oh, that prophecy,” Harry said. “Sorry! It went clear out of my mind.” Harry thought he’d put too much force into the end statement, and was 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, Aha, now Mr Potter, what is this mysterious other prophecy you went to such lengths to deny— “That is foolish,” the Defence Professor said sharply, “if indeed you are telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial things. I have racked my brain much over the little that I heard, but such a small fragment is simply too little.” “You think the one who’s coming is the one who might’ve framed Her- mione?” said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another hypothesis, uncer- tain predicate referent, he-who-is-coming. “With no offence meant to Miss Granger,” the Defence Professor said with another frown, “her life or death does not seem that important. But someone was to come—one who, in your interpretation, was not already there—and someone so significant, and unknown as a player…who knows what else they may have done?” Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have to redo his Lord Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece of evi- dence in the mix. Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like through slits. “More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke— who was meant to hear it? It is said that fates are spoken to those with the power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore. Myself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four, Dumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney’s presence. You and I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her before that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was meant for one of us—before Dumbledore took the prophetess away. Did the Headmaster say nothing more to you?” Professor Quirrell’s voice was demanding now. “I thought I heard too much force in that denial, Mr Potter.” “Honestly, no,” Harry said. “It had honestly slipped clear out of my mind.” “Then I am rather put out with him,” Professor Quirrell said softly. “In fact, I think that I am angry.” Harry said nothing. He didn’t even sweat. It might’ve been a poor rea- son for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did happen to be innocent. Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in acknowledge- ment. “If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr Potter, you may go.” “I can think of one other suspect,” Harry said. “Someone you didn’t put on your list at all. Would you analyse him to me, Professor?” There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a sound in itself. “As for that suspect,” the Defence Professor said softly, “I think you shall prosecute him on your own, Mr Potter, without help from me. I have heard such requests before, and experience leads me to refuse. Either I will do too good a job of prosecuting myself, and convince you that I am guilty—or else you will decide that my prosecution was too half-hearted, and that I am guilty. I will remark only this in my defence—that I would have needed a very good reason indeed to jeopardize your fragile alliance with the heir to House Malfoy.” 1451 CH APTER 86 1452 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1453 CH APTER 86 1454 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1455 CH APTER 86 1456 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1457 CH APTER 86 1458 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING Hypothesis: Severus Snape (April 8th, 1992, 9:03 p.m.) Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning stairs, turning without descending; or at least one Harry stood upon those stairs—his other three selves had been left behind in the Headmaster’s office. “Can I ask you a private question?” Harry said, when he thought they were far enough away not to be heard. “And in particular, private from the Headmaster.” “Yes,” Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. “Though I hope you realize that I cannot do anything which conflicts with my duties to—” “Yes,” Harry said, “that’s exactly what I need to ask you about. In front of the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that Hermione was no part of House Potter and that he wouldn’t take the money, you told Hermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if something like that comes up again, if your first duty is to the Hogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the Order of the Phœnix, Albus Dumbledore.” Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face with a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she’d been told that somebody was about to do it again, and not to flinch. Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he needed to pick up the knack of not phrasing things to hit as hard as he possibly could. The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they de- scended. “Oh, Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall said with a low exhalation. “I…wish you wouldn’t ask me such questions…oh, Harry, I wasn’t think- ing then, not at all. I only saw a chance to help Miss Granger and…I was Sorted into Gryffindor, after all.” “You’ve got a chance to think now,” Harry said. It was all coming out wrong, but he had to say it anyway, because—“I’m not asking you to be loyal to me. But if you do know—if you are sure—what you’ll do if it comes down to an innocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phœnix a second time…” But Professor McGonagall shook her head. “I’m not sure,” the Transfig- uration Professor whispered. “I don’t know if it was the right choice even then. I’m sorry. I can’t decide such awful things!” “But you’ll do something if it happens again,” Harry said. “Indecision is also a choice. You can’t just imagine having to make an immediate deci- sion?” “No,” Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and Harry realized that he’d accidentally offered a way out. The Professor’s next words confirmed Harry’s fears. “Such a dreadful choice as that, Mr Potter—I think I should not make it until I must.” Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to expect Professor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice would feel bad either way, so you could temporarily save yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of incurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late… but you couldn’t expect a witch to know all that. “All right,” Harry said. Though it wasn’t right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want that debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of that debt. And if the Defence Professor was David Monroe, or could convincingly appear to be David Monroe, then Lord Voldemort technically hadn’t exter- minated the House of Monroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe. In which case Hermione’s vow of service to a Noble House might be null and void. Or maybe not. Harry didn’t know anything about the legalities, espe- cially not whether House Potter got the money back if someone managed to send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost something might not mean the payment was returned, legally speaking. Harry wasn’t sure and he didn’t dare ask a magical solicitor… …it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one adult to take Hermione’s side instead of Dumbledore’s, if an issue like that threatened to come up. The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before the backs of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside, revealing the hallway. Harry stepped out— A hand caught at Harry’s shoulder. “Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, “why did you tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?” Harry turned around again. “You told me to keep watch, and see if he’d changed,” Professor Mc- Gonagall went on, her tone urgent. “Why did you say that, Mr Potter?” It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and remem- ber why he had said that. Harry and Neville had rescued Lesath Lestrange from bullies, and then Harry had confronted Severus in the hallway and, at least according to the Potions Master’s own words, ‘almost died’— “I learned something that made me worry,” Harry said after a moment. “From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else.” Severus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn’t be shared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it. “Mr Potter—” began Professor McGonagall, and then exhaled, the flash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had come. “Never mind. If you cannot say, you cannot say.” “Why do you ask?” Harry said. Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate— “All right, let me be more specific,” Harry said. After Professor Quirrell had done it to him several times, Harry was starting to get the hang of it. “What change have you already observed in Professor Snape that you’re trying to decide whether to tell me about?” “Harry—” the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed her mouth. “I obviously know something you don’t,” Harry said helpfully. “See, this is why we can’t always put off trying to decide our awful moral dilemmas.” Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath, pinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. “All right,” she said. “It’s a subtle thing…but worrying. How can I put this…Mr Potter, have you read many books that young children are not meant to read?” “I’ve read all of them.” “Of course you have. Well…I don’t quite understand it myself, but for so long as Severus has been employed in this school, stalking about in that awful stained cloak, there has been a certain sort of girl that stares at him with longing eyes—” “You say that like it’s a bad thing?” Harry said. “I mean, if there’s one thing I did understand from those books, it’s that you’re not supposed to question people’s preferences.” Professor McGonagall gave Harry a very strange look. “I mean,” Harry said again, “from what I’ve read, when I’m a bit older there’s something like a 10% chance that I’ll find Professor Snape attrac- tive, and the important thing is for me to just accept whatever I—” “In any case, Mr Potter, Severus has always been entirely indifferent to the stares of those young girls. But now—” Professor McGonagall seemed to realize something, and hastily said, her hands rising in ward- ing, “Please don’t mistake me, Professor Snape certainly has not taken advantage of any young witches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at one, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop gaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away. That I have seen with my own eyes.” “Er…” Harry said. “Sorry, but just because I’ve read those books doesn’t mean I understood them. What does all that mean?” “That he is noticing,” Professor McGonagall said in a low voice. “It is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am certain. And that means…I am very much afraid…that the bond which held Severus to Albus’s cause… may have weakened, or even broken.” 2 + 2 =… “Snape and Dumbledore?” Then Harry heard the words that had just come out of his mouth, and hastily added, “Not that there’s anything wrong with that—” “No!” said Professor McGonagall. “Oh, for pity’s sake—I can’t explain it to you, Mr Potter!” The other shoe finally dropped. He was still in love with my mother? This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for around five seconds before the third shoe dropped. Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful relationship advice. “I see,” Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were times when saying ‘Oops’ didn’t fully cover it. “You’re right, that’s not a good sign.” Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. “Whatever you’re thinking right now,” she said in a slightly muffled voice, “which I assure you is also wrong, I don’t want to hear about it, ever.” “So…” Harry said. “If, like you said, the bond that held Professor Snape to the Headmaster has broken…what would he do then?” There was a long silence. “I don’t know,” Professor McGonagall finally said. “I truly don’t know at all. I can’t even imagine. Do you know anything of this, Mr Potter?” “Er…” Harry said. “I think I can say that my own evidence points in the same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the probability that Profes- sor Snape isn’t in love with my mother any more.” Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. “I give up.” “I don’t know of anything wrong he’s done apart from that, though,” Harry added. “I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask me about this?” Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall. “Please don’t, Harry.” “All right,” Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the hallways, hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after, and the rum- bling sound of the gargoyles moving into place. 1465 CH APTER 86 1466 MULTIPLE H YPOTHESIS TESTING 1467 CH APTER 86 1468 1469 CH APTER 87 1470 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1471 CH APTER 87 1472 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1473 CH APTER 87 1474 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1475 CH APTER 87 1476 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1477 CH APTER 87 1478 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1479 CH APTER 87 1480 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1481 CH APTER 87 1482 HE DONIC AWARE NESS 1483 CH APTER 87 Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his library desk, from which vantage point he’d just watched Granger flee the library, sobbing. He hadn’t been able to hear the argument, but it had clearly been one of those. Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the Boy-Who- Lived, who was staring in the direction of the library doors, still vibrating from the force of how they’d been slammed. Tano didn’t particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter had been Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was, technically, his fellow Ravenclaw. And that meant there was a Code. The Boy-Who-Lived didn’t say anything as Tano approached him, but his gaze wasn’t friendly. Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter’s shoulder, and recited, his voice cracking only slightly, “Witches! Go figure, huh?” “Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer darkness.” The library doors slammed open again in the wake of another depar- ture. CHAPTER EIGHT Y-EIGHT TIME PRESSURE, PART I April 16th, 1992 12:07 p.m. Lunchtime. Harry stomped over to the mostly-deserted Gryffindor table, de- termining at a glance that lunch today was breen and Roopo balls. The ambient conversation, Harry could likewise hear, was Quidditch-related; an auditory environment which rated somewhat worse than the sound of rusty chainsaws, but better than what the Ravenclaw table was still blither- ing about Hermione. Gryffindor House, at least, had started out less sym- pathetic to Draco Malfoy and had more political incentive to wish that everyone would just forget certain unfortunate facts; and if that wasn’t the right reason for silence, it was at least silence. Dean and Seamus and Lavender were all gone for the holidays, but at least that left… “What was all that ruckus at the Head Table?” Harry said to the Weasley twin group-mind, as he began to serve himself his own plate. “It looked like it was just ending as I walked in.” “Our beloved, but clumsy Professor Trelawney—” “Seems to have gone and dropped an entire soup tureen on herself—” “Not to mention Mr Hagrid.” A quick glance at the Head Table confirmed that the Divination Pro- fessor was waving her wand frantically as the half-Giant dabbed at his clothes. Nobody else seemed to be paying much attention, even Professor McGonagall. Professor Flitwick was standing on his chair as usual, the Headmaster seemed to be absent again (he’d been gone most days of the holiday), Professors Sprout and Sinistra and Vector were eating in their usual grouping, and— “You know,” Harry said, as he turned his head away to stare at the ceil- ing illusion of a clear blue sky, “that still creeps me out sometimes.” “What does?” said Fred or George. The powerful and enigmatic Defence Professor was ‘resting’ or whatever-the-heck-was-wrong-with-him, his hands making fumbling, hesitant grabs at a chicken-leg that seemed to be eluding him on the plate. “Eh, nothing,” said Harry. “I’m not quite used to Hogwarts, yet.” Harry continued to eat in moderate silence, as various Weasleys dis- cussed some bizarre mind-affecting substance called Chudley Cannons. “What sort of deep mysterious thoughts are you thinking?” said a young-looking witch with short hair, sitting nearby. “I mean, just curi- ous. I’m Brienne, by the way.” She was gazing at him with one of those looks which Harry had firmly decided to just ignore until he was older. “So,” Harry said, “you know those really simple Artificial Intelligence programs like ELIZA that are programmed to use words in syntactic En- glish sentences only they don’t contain any understanding of what the words mean?” “Of course,” the witch said. “I have a dozen of them in my trunk.” “Well, I’m pretty sure my understanding of girls is somewhere around that level.” A sudden hush fell. It took a few seconds for Harry to realize that, no, the entire Great Hall wasn’t staring at him, and then Harry twisted his head around to look. The figure who’d just staggered into the Great Hall appeared to be Mr Filch, Hogwarts’s token hallway monitor; who, along with his preda- tory cat Mrs Norris, constituted a low-level random encounter whom Harry often breezed past wearing his epic-level Deathly Hallow. (Harry had once consulted the Weasley twins about pulling some sort of prank on this deserving target, whereupon Fred or George had quietly pointed out that Mr Filch was never seen to use a wand, which was odd, really, considering how many spells would be useful in that position, and it made you wonder why Dumbledore had given the man a position at Hogwarts, and Harry had shut up.) Right now Mr Filch’s brown clothing was disarrayed and soaked with sweat, his shoulders were visibly heaving as he breathed, and his ever- present cat was missing. “Troll—” gasped Mr Filch. “In the dungeons—” 1489 CH APTER 88 149 0 TIME PRESSURE I …and he still didn’t realize. Tick. As Harry stared with narrowed eyes at where the Professors had gone out, wondering what was actually going on and what it meant, as the stu- dents came together into a more defensible mass and wands flicked to levitate the tables out of their way, Harry still didn’t realize. Tick. “Shouldn’t the Professors all have formed up into pairs?” said an older Gryffindor student whose name Harry didn’t know. “I mean—it’d be slower, but it’d be safer, I think—” Tick. Someone else replied to this, raising her voice, but Harry didn’t catch much of it, the gist was that mountain trolls were highly magic-resistant and incredibly strong and could regenerate but they were still noisy so if you heard them coming, it shouldn’t be that hard for a Hogwarts Professor to wrap them up in Vadim’s Unbreakable something something. Tick. And Harry still didn’t realize. Tick. The crowd noises were subdued, people were talking in low voices to each other while they glanced around, listening for the sound of a crash- ing door or an angry roar. Tick. Some students were speculating in whispers about what the Defence Professor could possibly be trying to achieve by smuggling in a troll, and whether he was angry that Professor McGonagall had caught on to his at- tempted distraction, and what it was a distraction from. Tick. And the thought still didn’t come to Harry, not until after all the students had formed a mass of perhaps a hundred bodies patrolled by proudly grim-looking seventh-year students with their wands all pointed outward, and somebody suggested doing a headcount, and someone else replied sarcastically that this might have made sense on some other day, but right now practically everyone was gone for the spring holiday and nobody really knew how many students were supposed to be in the room, let alone if any were missing. Tick. That was when Harry wondered where Hermione was. Tick. Harry looked over at where the Ravenclaws had clustered, he didn’t see Hermione but then everyone was packed tightly-enough together that you wouldn’t expect to see smaller students through the crowd, amid the upper-years. Tick. Harry then looked over at the Hufflepuffs to see if he could spot Neville, and even though Neville was standing behind a much taller stu- dent, Harry’s visual processing managed to spot him almost immediately. Hermione wasn’t with the Hufflepuffs either, not that Harry could see— and she certainly wouldn’t be with the Slytherins— Tick. Harry pushed his way through the packed crowd, stepping beside or around older students and in one case just ducking between their legs, until he was standing among the Ravenclaws and could definitely verify that, nope, no Hermione. Tick. “Hermione Granger!” Harry said loudly. “Are you here?” Nobody answered. Tick. Somewhere in the back of his mind was a rising sense of horror, as other parts of him tried to decide exactly how much to panic. The first Defence class of the year was rather fuzzy in Harry’s mind, but he dis- tantly remembered something about trolls being able to track prey that was alone and undefended. Tick. Another line of thought sorted frantically through inchoate possibil- ities; what could he do exactly? It wasn’t 3 p.m. yet so he couldn’t reach this now using his Time-Turner. Even if he could sneak out of the room— there had to be some way to put on his Cloak without being noticed, some sort of distraction he could use—he had no idea where Hermione was, and Hogwarts was huge. Tick. Another part of his mind tried to model possibilities. From what that other student had said, trolls weren’t silent predators, they were noisy— Hermione won’t have any idea it’s a troll, so she’ll go investigate the noise. She’s a heroine, isn’t she? —but Hermione now had an invisibility cloak and a broomstick in her pouch. Harry had insisted on that part for both her and Neville, and Pro- fessor McGonagall had told him it’d been done. That ought to be enough to let Hermione get away, even if she was lousy on a broomstick. All she had to do was get onto a section of roof, it was a clear day and sunlight was supposed to be bad for trolls somehow, Harry remembered that part and therefore Hermione would remember it exactly. And surely, even if Hermione wanted to prove herself again, she couldn’t possibly be dumb enough to attack a mountain troll. Tick. She wouldn’t. Tick. That just wasn’t her. Tick. And then it occurred to Harry that somebody had previously tried to frame Hermione Granger for murder using Memory Charms. Had done so inside Hogwarts, without setting off any alarms. And had arranged for Draco to die slowly enough that it wouldn’t set off the wards until at least six hours later when nobody could use a Time-Turner to check. And that whoever was clever enough to infiltrate a troll past the ancient wards of Hogwarts without the Headmaster coming to investigate the strange creature, could be clever enough to also take the obvious step of jinxing Hermione’s magic items… Tick. There was a part of him that felt something like slowly rising panic as perspective shifted, a Necker Cube changing orientation, what the hell had Harry been thinking, letting Hermione and Neville be kept inside Hogwarts just because of them being given a few stupid trinkets, that wasn’t going to stop anyone who wanted to kill them. Tick. Another part of his mind put up resistance, that possibility wasn’t cer- tain, it was complex and the probability could easily be under 50%. It was easy to imagine going into a huge panic in front of everyone and then Hermione getting back from the toilets outside the Great Hall. Or if the troll ended up not going anywhere near her…like in the story of the boy who cried wolf, nobody would believe him the next time if she really was in trouble; it could use up reputational credit that he would later need for something else… Tick. Harry recognized an instance of the fear-of-embarrassment schema that stopped most people from ever doing anything under conditions of uncertainty, and squashed it down hard. Even then it was strange how much willpower it took to muster the decision to shout out loud in front of everyone, if he just hadn’t seen Hermione in the crowd it was going to be embarrassing… Tick. Harry drew in a deep breath and shouted as loudly as he could, “Her- mione Granger! Are you here?” The students all turned to look at him. Then some of them turned around to look around themselves. The noise around the room went down in volume as some conversations stilled. “Has anyone seen Hermione Granger since— since around ten-thirty today or so? Does anyone have any idea where she might be?” The background babble stilled further. Nobody raised their voice to shout anything at him, in particular not, Don’t worry, Harry, I’m right here. “Oh, Merlin,” somebody said from nearby, and then the background babble started up again, taking on a new and excited tone. Harry stared down at his hands, shutting out the yammering and tried to think, think, think— Tick. Tick. Tick. Susan Bones and a red-headed boy with a battered-looking wand both shoved their way through the crowd to Harry at the same time. “We’ve got to let the Professors know somehow—” “We’ve got to go find her—” “Find her?” Susan snapped, rounding on the other boy. “How’ll we do that, Captain Weasley?” “We’ll go off and look for her!” Ron Weasley snapped back. “Are you nuts? There’s already Professors searching the hallways, what makes you think we’ve got any better chance than them of running across General Granger? Only we’ll get eaten by the troll! And then expelled!” It was odd, how sometimes hearing bad ideas made the right idea ob- vious by contrast. “All right everyone! Listen up!” People turned to look. “Quiet! Everyone! Shut up!” Harry’s throat ached after that, but he had everyone’s attention. “I have a broomstick,” Harry said as loudly as he could manage with his throat still hurting. He’d remembered Azkaban, and the broomstick which had only sat two, when he’d requested one that could carry three. “It’s a 3-seater. I need one seventh-year from the armies to come with me. We’re going to fly through the hallways as fast as possible looking for Hermione Granger, pick her up, and come back immediately. Who’s with me?” The Great Hall became entirely silent, then. 1496 TIME PRESSURE I Harry stared at the silent crowd, the dozen seventh-years looking sternly outward, feeling the coldness coming over him. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Professor Quirrell was laughing scornfully and mocking the idea that ordinary fools would ever do something useful of their own will, without a wand pointed at their heads… Tick. The standard remedy for bystander apathy was to focus on a single individual. “All right,” Harry said, trying to keep the commanding voice of the Boy-Who-Lived who didn’t doubt obedience. “Miss Morgan, come with me, now. We’ve got no time to waste.” The witch he’d named turned from where she’d been staring steadily out at the perimeter, her expression aghast for the one second before her face closed up. “The Deputy Headmistress ordered us all to stay here, Mr Potter.” It took an effort for Harry to unclench his teeth. “Professor Quirrell didn’t say that and neither did you. Professor McGonagall isn’t a tactician, she didn’t think to check if we had missing students and she thought it was a good idea to start marching students through the hallways. But Profes- sor McGonagall understands after her mistakes are pointed out to her, you saw how she listened to you and Professor Quirrell, and I’m certain that she wouldn’t want us to just ignore the fact that Hermione Granger is out there, alone—” Tick. “I’d expect the Professor to say she’d not wish any more students roam- ing the halls. The Professor said if anyone left for any reason, they’d be ex- pelled. Maybe you don’t need to worry because you’re the Boy-Who-Lived, but the rest of us do!” Tick. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Professor Quirrell was just laugh- ing at him. Expecting some normal person to act without perfect strategic clarity, without a clear focus of responsibility on them personally, when they had a good excuse to do nothing… “A student’s life is at stake,” Harry said in a level voice. “She could be fighting the troll right now. Out of curiosity, does that mean anything to you at all?” Tick. Miss Morgan’s face twisted. “You—you’re the Boy-Who-Lived! Just go off by yourself and snap your fingers, if you want to help her!” Tick. Harry was hardly even aware of what he was saying. “That’s just clev- erness and bluffing, I don’t have any power like that in real life, a young girl needs your help now are you a Gryffindor or not?” “Why are you saying any of this to me?” cried Miss Morgan. “I wasn’t left in charge here! Mr Hagrid was!” There was an awkward pause that suffused the whole room. Harry spun to look up at the huge half-giant towering over the crowd of students, as all other heads also turned toward him as one. “Mr Hagrid,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice commanding. “You need to authorize this expedition and you need to do it now.” Rubeus Hagrid looked conflicted, though that was hard to judge with his vast head so surrounded by his unshorn beard and locks; only his eyes looked alive, embedded in all that hair. “Eh…” said the half-giant. “I was tol’ to keep yeh all safe—” “Great, now can we also keep Hermione Granger safe? You know, the student framed for a murder she did not commit who needs someone to help her?” The half-giant started as Harry spoke the words. Harry stared at the enormous man, desperately willing him to pick up on the hint, hoping the words hadn’t given it away to anyone else—he couldn’t be just muscle, surely James and Lily had been friends with this man out of more than pity— “Framed?” called out an anonymous voice, from somewhere over near where the Slytherins gathered. “Ha, are you still on that? It’d serve her right if she did get eaten.” There was some laughter, even as cries of indignation came from else- where. The half-giant’s face firmed up. “Yeh stay here, lad,” Mr Hagrid said in a booming tone that was probably meant to be gentle. “I’ll go and look fer her meself. Truth is, trolls can be a mite tricky—yeh’ve got to catch ’em by an ankle and dangle ’em just right, or they’ll rip yeh clean in half—” “Can you ride a broomstick, Mr Hagrid?” “Eh—” Rubeus Hagrid frowned. “No.” “Then you can’t search fast enough. Sixth-years! Calling all sixth-years! Are there any sixth-years here who aren’t worthless cowards?” Silence. “Fifth years? Mr Hagrid, tell them they’re authorized to go with me and keep me safe! I’m trying to be sensible, damn it!” The half-giant wrung his hands with an agonized expression. “Eh— I—” Something snapped inside Harry and he started to stride directly to- ward the doors to the Great Hall, pushing aside anyone who didn’t get out of his way as though they were doughy statues. (He didn’t run, be- cause running was an invitation for somebody to stop you.) Somewhere in his mind he was moving through an empty room filled with mechanical puppets by whose meaningless lip-moving noises he’d been distracted— A huge figure interposed itself in his way. Harry looked up. “I can’t let yeh do that, Harry, not yeh of all people. There’s strange things afoot in this castle, and someone might be after Hermione—or they might be after yeh.” Rubeus Hagrid’s voice was regretful but firm, and his gigantic hands lay at his side like forklifts. “I can’t let yeh go out there, Harry Potter.” “Stupefy!” The red bolt crashed into the side of Hagrid’s head and made the huge man start. His head snapped around faster than anything that large should’ve moved, and bellowed, “What do yeh think yeh’re doing!” at the young form of Susan Bones. “Sorry!” she screamed. “Incendium! Glisseo!” The huge man’s hands, now slapping at the fire in his beard, didn’t quite manage to catch himself as he crashed to the floor, but it didn’t matter by then because Harry was past him and— Neville Longbottom stepped in front of him, looking desperate but determined, the Hufflepuff boy’s wand already level in his hand. Harry’s hand went for his wand in a sheer reflex action, he barely man- aged to check himself before Neville could fire on him, staring at his Lieu- tenant as though the world had gone mad. “Harry!” Neville burst out. “Harry, Mr Hagrid’s right, you can’t, this could all be a trap, they could be after you—” All of Neville’s muscles went rigid and he toppled to the ground, stiff as a board. A pale-looking Ron Weasley stepped out from behind Neville, his own wand level, and said, “Go.” “Ron, you madman, what are you doing—” came a voice distantly identi- fiable as Miss Clearwater’s boyfriend, but Harry was already dashing for the door without looking back, even as Ron’s voice and Susan’s voice rose again in incantation. There was a huge indignant bellow, and unknown voices began to yell. Then Harry was through, his hand reaching into his pouch and his voice was saying “broomstick”, as behind him the great doors began to swing shut again. Harry continued running through the Entrance Hall even as the long three-person broomstick and its sets of stirrups began to protrude from the pouch, repeating a number of swearwords in his head and thinking this is what happens when you try to be sensible with the part of his mind that wasn’t trying to figure out a search pattern to cover places where Hermi- one might be. The Library was on the third floor and practically on the other side of the castle…Harry had almost reached the great marble stair- case by the time the broomstick was in his hand and “Up!” he was in the air and accelerating up toward the second floor— “Gah!” Harry screamed, and barely managed to spin his broom in the air so that he didn’t impale one of the human figures lurking at the top of the stairs. There was a ghastly moment of trying not to fall off the broom, perform the twists that would keep him in the stirrups, despite being re- ally close to the ground and having almost no room to manœuvre and then— “Fred? George?” “We can’t figure out how to find her!” one of the Weasley twins blurted, hands twisting in distress. “We sneaked out because we thought we could find Miss Granger—there has to be a quick way to find anyone inside the Hogwarts castle, we’re both sure of it—but we can’t figure out what it is!” Harry stared at both of them, from where he was hanging upside- down from the broomstick where his desperate manœuvre had brought him, and entirely by reflex his mouth said, “Well, why were you so sure you could find her?” “We don’t know!” cried the other Weasley twin. “Have you been able to find people inside Hogwarts before?” “Yes! We—” and the Weasley twin who was speaking stopped abruptly, both redheads staring off into the distance with a blank expression. There was a thundering crash, as of two huge doors being shoved open by someone very, very strong. Harry spun around in the air to present the two open stirrup- positions on the broomstick to the Weasley twins, he didn’t say any- thing, there was no reason for them to give away their positions if they didn’t have to. Time seemed to move too slowly as the Weasley twins scrambled into the stirrups, Harry’s heart beating hard despite his men- tal calculation that Mr Hagrid, running, shouldn’t reach even the foot of the stairway in time. Then the three of them were accelerating hard and away toward the nearest corridor, the stone floor beneath them blurring and the walls seeming to make an audible whooshing sound (though that was just the wind in their ears) as they went past; Harry remembered that he was riding a longer three-person broomstick barely in time to slow down for the next turn. And now all the broomstick seats were occupied, but if they actu- ally found Hermione then—Harry could put on the Cloak of Invisibility, that should hide him from the troll, and that would free up a seat for Hermione— Harry ducked hard before a sudden archway took his head off. “We found Jesse!” the Weasley twin seated behind Harry blurted. “I know we did! That time we needed to tell him that Filch was hunting for him!” “How?” Harry said, most of his brain engaged in not dying in a hor- rible air accident. He should have slowed down for safety, but there was a tension rising in him, a sourceless dread. He couldn’t slow down, some- thing terrible would happen if he slowed down… “We—” said the Weasley twin seated lower down. “We can’t remem- ber!” Another sharp turn taken at, Harry estimated, roughly 0.3% of the speed of light, and they were going through a twisty curving corridor that Harry always took to get from the Great Hall to the library only it wasn’t the shortest way if you were on a broomstick, he should’ve taken the long straight West Corridor instead— The part of his brain that wasn’t steering caught up with reality. “Someone’s been tampering with your minds!” Harry yelled, as he weaved through the curving corridor so fast that the tail-end Weasley sometimes lightly smacked into the wall as the length of the broomstick conflicted with Harry’s maladapted air skills. “What?” cried Fred or George. “Whoever got to Hermione messed with your minds too!” It could be an Obliviation, it could be a False Memory that hadn’t been planted right, but right now Harry couldn’t think— The broomstick turned and shot upward along a spiral staircase, all three of them flattened themselves against the broomstick so they could make in through the gap in the ceiling that opened onto the third floor, and then they were in front of the library, the broomstick slowing to a halt with a shriek despite the lack of anything it could be friction-braking against. Harry shot the Weasley twins a quick glance to stay put, as he clambered off the broomstick to shove open the doors of the library, con- trolling his breathing as he shoved his head inside. Hermione Granger wasn’t there. Madam Pince, who was eating a sandwich at her desk, looked up with a sudden glare. “Library’s closed!” “Have you seen Hermione Granger?” Harry said. “I said the library’s closed, boy! Lunch hours!” “This is extremely important. Have you seen Hermione Granger or do you have any idea where she might be?” “No, now be off!” “Do you have any fast way of contacting Professor McGonagall in an emergency?” “Eh?” said the librarian, startled. She rose up from behind her desk. “What is—” “Yes or no. Please answer immediately.” “Ah—there’s the Floo—” “She’s not in her office,” Harry said. “Do you have any other way of reaching her. Yes or no.” “Young man, I insist that you—” Harry’s brain flagged this as I’m talking to NPCs again and he spun on his heel and dashed back for the broomstick. “Stop!” cried Madam Pince, bursting too late from the doors as Harry and the Weasley twins shot off again, out of the librarian’s sight. The pres- sure in Harry’s mind still rising, like a physical hand squeezing his chest, he had to find Hermione and he had no other notion of where she could be, unless it was the witches’ dorms in the Ravenclaw tower and that he couldn’t enter. Searching all of Hogwarts bordered on a mathematical im- possibility, there probably was no continuous flight path that entered all the rooms at least once—why hadn’t he thought to demand for Hermione and Neville and him to be given a set of those neat little mirrors the Aurors used to communicate— The realization that he was being stupid hit Harry like a blow to the stomach. He didn’t need mirrors to send a message, he hadn’t needed mirrors since January. Harry slowed the broomstick to a halt in mid-air of a hallway, his wand already coming into his hand, the driving will to protect Hermione Granger rising to the front of his mind like a sun of silver fire and flowing down his arm as he cried “Expecto Patronum!” and the blazing white humanoid burst into existence like a nova, the Weasley twins’ voices crying aloud in shock. “Tell Hermione Granger—that there’s a troll loose in Hogwarts—it could be hunting for her—she needs to get into direct sunlight, now!” The silver figure turned as though it was departing, and then van- ished. “Merlin’s underpants,” breathed Fred or George. The silver outline blasted back into the world, and said in the strange version of Harry’s own voice, “Hermione Granger says,” the blazing fig- ure’s voice became higher-pitched, “AHHHHHHHHH!” Time seemed to fracture, like everything was moving very quickly and slowly at the same time. A desperate impulse to accelerate the broomstick, fly at its maximum speed, only Harry didn’t know where— “If you know where she is,” Harry shouted to the blazing humanoid figure, staring into it as though it were a sun, “then take me to her!” The silver blaze moved and Harry accelerated after it, the Weasley twins giving out high-pitched shrieks behind him as he fired through the air like a cannonball, moving faster than sanity, he didn’t focus on the walls whizzing past him or how fast he was moving, just followed the silver light through corridors and flying up staircases and blitzing through doors that Fred or George cried desperate incantations to open and it was all still taking too much time, somewhere deep inside Harry felt like he was sinking through molasses as windows and portraits shot past. The broomstick screamed through a final turn that whacked one of the Weasley twins against the wall not quite as hard as a Bludger would hit, and then they followed the brilliant Patronus through an open space in the ceilings, blasting up and upwards, rising past one floor and then another in less than a breath. His Patronus slowed to a halt (Harry braking hard in response) just as they reached the level of a wide-open floor space that spread out until it escaped the ceiling and turned into an outdoor terrace, a spread of tiled marble open to the air and sky— CHAPTER EIGHT Y-NINE TIME PRESSURE, PART II Cool blue fires clung to the floor in small masses, surrounding a blazing pool that seemed to burn with a deadlier, hotter blue. In one narrow circle the marble tiles were scorched and shattered by some explosive spell that only the most prodigious of first-year witches could have cast, with the last of her strength. On the terrace, still moving beneath the open sunlight, stood a great lumpy creature of dull granite-grey. Body like a boulder with small bald head perched on top like a stone, short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. One hand held a tremendous stone club as long and as wide as an adult human, and the other hand held The Weasley twins screamed. Harry’s Patronus shattered. The troll snorted and spun around to face them, dropping into the red pool that had spread out beneath its feet, raising its club high. Then a Weasley cried an incantation and the club was torn from the troll’s hand, smashed into its face so hard it drove the troll back for one of its steps, a blow that might have killed a Muggle. The troll gave a bel- low of anger, its nose squashed and blood-spattered, and then the nose straightened once more, regenerated. The troll grabbed with both hands for the club, which shot away through the air but only barely dodged the grab. “Lead it away, keep it off me,” said a voice. The levitated club moved backwards from the troll, from the terrace onto the wide-open floor beneath the ceiling; and the troll made a great prodigious leap that almost brought the club into its hands. Then the troll made another great leap as the club moved to one side; and the broom- stick moved forwards and Harry jumped off and ran towards where Her- mione Granger was lying in a pool of her own blood with her legs eaten away to the upper thighs. Harry’s hands tore open the healer’s kit from his pouch, grabbed one of the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one ragged tooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood, they didn’t tremble, there wasn’t any allowance for his hands to tremble. As the tourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard and more blood came out, but then the bleeding stopped on that thigh-stump, and Harry turned to the other. Part of his mind was screaming, screaming, screaming and even the part of him picking up the other self-tightening tourniquet heard it, but that also wasn’t allowed. The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another in rapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty sec- onds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in perfect coordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in harmless show- ers of sparks against the troll’s skin. As the other tourniquet tightened itself in another pulse of blood, Harry looked up at a “Diffindo!” / “Re- ducto!” that made the troll’s vulnerable eyes explode in twin showers of vitreous humour, but the troll only bellowed once more, its eyes already reforming. “Fire and acid!” Harry shouted. “Use fire or acid!” “Fuego!” / “Incendio!” Harry heard, but he wasn’t looking, he was reach- ing for the syringe of glowing orange liquid that was the oxygenating potion, pushing it into Hermione’s neck at what Harry hoped was the carotid artery, to keep her brain alive even if her lungs or heart stopped, so long as her brain stayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the plunger of the syringe all the way down, creating a faint glow beneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then pushed down on her chest, where her heart should be, hard compressions that he hoped was moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could reach her brain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he hadn’t actually thought to check her pulse. Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his mind go- ing blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was there, if anything, he could use. The screaming in that distant corner of his mind was get- ting louder, much louder, now that his hands had stopped their frantic motions. He was suddenly aware of the liquid sensation where blood had soaked through his robes and the knees of his trousers. From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the troll, and he heard one of the Weasley twins shout “Deligitor prodeas!” and then, “Help! Do something!” Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the Weasley twins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head, facing off against the troll which held the huge stone club in both its hands, looking somewhat scorched now and with one or two smoking scars across its arms, but still intact. And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it seemed to shake the walls, “GRYFFINDOR!” A pulse of power burned the air, magic almost tangible even to Harry’s undeveloped senses; the troll jumped back a pace with a snort of surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face, swept the Hat off his head with a motion smooth as a magician’s trick, and reached in with one hand and drew forth a hilt whose pommel was a glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of gleaming white metal, and a blade as long as a tall child. As the sword was revealed the air seemed to fill with a silent scream of fury. Upon the blade was written in golden script, nihil supernum. Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge blade weighed nothing, and screamed and charged. Harry’s lips opened to say something, some long sentence like, No, stop, you have no idea how to use a sword but not even a single syllable left his lips before the sword sliced off the troll’s right arm through the el- bow, cutting through skin and flesh and bone like jelly; just as the already- swinging arc of the stone club smashed into the charging Weasley twin and sent him flying through the air above the marble floor, over the gap out of which they’d risen on the broomstick, until that Weasley hit the wall on the opposite side and then collapsed into an unmoving heap. The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor, clatter- ing distantly as it dropped. “Fred!” screamed George Weasley, and then “Ventus!” An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways through the air. “Ventus!” The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the gap lead- ing downwards. “Ventus!” But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its remaining hand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold. The third blow sent the troll’s body over the gap; but the hand remained at the edge. And then the troll was pulling itself back up single-handedly, roaring. George Weasley staggered, almost falling, his hand dropping to his side. “Harry—” the Weasley twin said in a strained voice, “Run—” The remaining Weasley twin took a step sideways, slumped against the wall, and slid to the ground. Time was fractured in Harry’s mind, the world around him seemed to move slowly, distorted, or perhaps it was his own mind twisting and folding. He should have been moving, doing something, but a strange paralysis seemed to be stopping all his muscles, all his motions. Without any time for words, thoughts came in flashes of concepts: that if Harry ran away the troll would eat the Weasley twins as well as Hermione, that if Bludgers didn’t kill wizards then Fred should still be alive, that the Weasley twins were more powerful spell-casters than him and they hadn’t been able to hold back the troll, there was no time to Transfigure anything he didn’t already possess, the troll seemed too agile to be lured over the edge of the terrace to fall off the sides of the Hogwarts castle, someone had enchanted the troll against sunlight before using it as a murder weapon and might also have strengthened it in other ways. And then a mental image of Hermione running from the troll, running for sunlight, finally reaching the bright terrace with the troll hot on her heels, only to find that someone else had thought of that possibility, too. The screaming horror in his mind was drowned out by another emo- tion. Harry stood up. On the other side of the room, the enemy had also risen, the unregen- erating stump of one sword-cut arm still bloody. intent to kill The troll grasped its fallen club in its remaining hand, and gave a huge bellow, smashing the club into the floor and sending marble chips flying. think purely of killing The troll began to lumber towards where George had fallen, a thin string of drool trailing from the side of its lips. grasp at any means to do so Harry took five strides forward, and the enemy gave another bellow and turned away from George, its eyes focusing squarely on him. censors off, do not flinch The third most perfect killing machine in nature bounded towards him in leaping steps. KILL Harry’s left hand already held the Transfigured diamond from his ring, his right hand already held his wand. “Wingardium Leviosa.” Harry’s wand directed the tiny jewel into the troll’s mouth. “Finite Incantatem.” The troll’s head blew off its spine as the rock expanded back into its old form, and Harry stepped aside as the Enemy’s body crashed where he’d been standing. The enemy’s head was already beginning to regenerate, the ragged stump of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing itself and replacing its teeth. Harry bent down and picked up the troll’s head by its left ear. His wand jammed through the troll’s left eye, plunging through the jelly-like mate- rial and passing through the wide socket in the bone. Harry visualized a one-millimetre-wide cross-section through the enemy’s brain, and Trans- figured it into sulphuric acid. The enemy stopped regenerating. Harry threw the corpse over the edge of the terrace and turned back to Hermione. Her eyes were moving, and focused on him. Harry crouched beside her, ignoring the blood soaking more of his already-soaked robes. You’ll be all right, his brain formed the sentence, but his lips wouldn’t move. You’ll be all right, we’ll find some magic to fix all this, put you back to normal, just hold on, don’t— Hermione’s lips were moving, just a tiny bit but they were moving. “your…fault…” Time froze. Harry should have told her not to talk, to save her breath, only he couldn’t unblock his lips. Hermione drew in another breath, and her lips whispered, “Not your fault.” Then she exhaled, and closed her eyes. Harry stared at her with his mouth half-open, his breath caught in his throat. “Don’t do this,” said his voice. He’d only been two minutes late. Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the air as though reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again. There was a burst of something that was magic and also more, a shout louder than an earthquake and containing a thousand books, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was Hermione; too vast to be understood, except that Harry suddenly knew that Hermione had whited out the pain, and was glad not to be dying alone. For a moment it seemed like the outpouring of magic might hold, take root in the castle’s stone; but then the outpouring ended and the magic faded, her body stopped moving and all motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceased to exist— No. Harry stood up from the body, swaying. No. There was a burst of flame and Dumbledore was standing there with Fawkes, his eyes filled with horror. “I felt a student die! What—” The old wizard’s eyes saw what lay upon the ground. “Oh, no,” whispered Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes gave a sad, mournful croon. “Bring her back.” There was silence on the terrace. Fred Weasley had risen up into the air at a gesture from Dumbledore’s wand and was floating towards them, surrounded by a reassuring pink glow. “Harry—” the old wizard began. His voice cracked. “Harry—” “Have Fawkes cry on her or whatever. Hurry up.” The voice that spoke sounded perfectly calm. “I, I can’t, Harry, it’s too late, she’s dead—” “I don’t want to hear about it. If it was me lying there, you’d pull some kind of amazing rabbit out of your hat and save me, right, because the hero isn’t allowed to die before the story’s over. Well, she’s the hero too, so whatever you were saving for that extra-special occasion, just go ahead and use it now. I promise I’ll pay you back.” “There isn’t anything I can do! Her soul has departed, she’s passed on!” Harry opened his mouth to scream out all his fury, and then closed it again. There wasn’t any point in screaming, it wouldn’t accomplish any- thing. The unbearable pressure rising inside him couldn’t be let out that way. Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at where the remains of Hermione Granger were lying in a pool of blood. Part of his mind was hammering at the world around him, trying to make it go away, wake up from the nightmare and find himself back in his Ravenclaw dorm with the morning sun shining through the curtains. But the blood remained and Harry didn’t wake up, and another part of him already knew that this event was real, part of the same flawed world that included Azkaban and the Wizengamot chamber and No With a fracturing feeling, as though time was still torn to pieces around him, Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at the remains of Hermione Granger lying in a pool of blood with two tourniquets tied around her thigh-stumps, and decided No. I do not accept this. There isn’t any reason to accept it, not when there’s magic in the world. Harry would learn whatever he had to learn, invent whatever he had to invent, rip the knowledge of Salazar Slytherin from the Dark Lord’s mind, discover the secret of Atlantis, open any gates or break any seals necessary, find his way to the root of all magic and reprogram it. He would rip apart the foundations of reality itself to get Hermione Granger back. 1512 TIME PRESSURE II 1513 1515 CH APTER 9 0 Minerva had seen Albus’s face and she’d known something was wrong; there had been time for her to wonder what had happened, and even who had died; her mind flashing to Alastor, to Augusta, to Arthur and Molly, all the most likely targets at the start of Voldemort’s second rise. She had thought that she had steeled herself, she had thought herself ready for the worst. Then Albus spoke, and all the steel left her. Not Hermione—no— Albus gave her a brief space to weep; and then told her that Harry Pot- ter, who had watched Miss Granger die, had seated himself outside the infirmary storeroom where Miss Granger’s remains were being kept, re- fusing to move from the spot, and telling anyone who spoke to him to go away so he could think. The only thing that had elicited any reaction from the boy was when Fawkes had tried to sing to him; Harry Potter had shrieked at the phœnix not to do that, his feelings were real, he didn’t want magic trying to heal them like they were a disease. After that Fawkes had refused to sing again. Albus thought that she might have the best chance of reaching Harry Potter now. So she had to pull herself together, and clean up her face; there would be time later for private grief, when her surviving children no longer needed her. Minerva McGonagall pulled together the dislocated pieces of herself, wiped her eyes a final time, and laid her hand on the doorknob of the infir- mary section whose back storeroom was now being used, for the second time this century and for the fifth time since the castle of Hogwarts had been raised, as the resting place of a promising young student. She opened the door. Harry Potter’s eyes gazed at her. The boy was sitting on the floor in front of the door to the back storeroom, and holding his wand in his lap. If those eyes were grieving, if they were empty, if they were even broken, it couldn’t be seen from looking at the boy’s face. There were no dried tears on those cheeks. “Why are you here, Professor McGonagall?” Harry Potter said. “I told the Headmaster I’d like to be left alone for a while.” She couldn’t think of anything to say. To help you—you’re not all right— but she didn’t know what to say, there was nothing she could imagine say- ing that would make things better. She hadn’t planned ahead before she’d walked into the room, having not been at her best. “What are you thinking about?” Minerva said. It was the only sentence that came into her mind. Albus had told her that Harry had been saying, over and over, that he was thinking; and she had to get Harry talking, somehow. Harry stared half at her and half past her, a tension coming into his face, as she held her breath. It took a while before Harry spoke. “I’m trying to think if there’s anything I should be doing right now,” said Harry Potter. “It’s hard, though. My mind keeps on imagining ways the past could have gone differently if I’d thought faster, and I can’t rule out that there might be a key insight in there somewhere.” “Mr Potter—” she said falteringly. “Harry, I don’t think it’s healthy for you to be—thinking like that—” “I disagree. It’s not thinking that gets people killed.” The words were spoken in a level monotone, as though reciting lines from a book. “Harry,” she said, hardly even thinking as she said it, “there’s nothing you could have done—” Something flickered in Harry’s expression. His eyes seemed to focus on her for the first time. “Nothing I could have done?” Harry’s voice rose on the last word. “Noth- ing I could have done? I’ve lost track of how many different ways I could’ve saved her! If I’d asked to have us all given communications mirrors! If I’d insisted on Hermione being taken out of Hogwarts and put in a school that isn’t insane! If I’d sneaked out immediately instead of trying to argue with normal people! If I’d re- membered the Patronus earlier! If I’d thought through possible emergencies and trained myself to think about Patronuses earlier! Even at the very last minute it might not have been too late! I killed the troll and turned to her and she was still ALIVE and I just knelt next to her listening to her last words like an IDIOT instead of casting the Patronus again and calling Dumbledore to send Fawkes! Or if I’d just approached the whole problem from a different angle—if I’d looked for a student with a Time-Turner to send a message back in time before I found out about anything happening to her, instead of ending up with an outcome that can’t be altered—I asked the Headmaster to go back and save Hermione and then fake everything, fake the dead body, edit every- one’s memories, but Dumbledore said that he tried something like that once and it didn’t work and he lost another friend instead. Or if I’d—if only I’d gone too—if, that night—” Harry pressed his hands over his face, and when he removed them again, his face was calm and composed once more. “Anyway,” said Harry Potter, now in a monotone again, “I don’t want to repeat that mistake, so I’m going to spend until dinner time thinking if there’s anything I should be doing. If I haven’t thought of anything by then I’ll go to dinner and eat. Now please go away.” She was aware now that tears were sliding down her cheeks, again. “Harry—Harry, you have to believe that this isn’t your fault!” “Of course it’s my fault. There’s no-one else here who could be respon- sible for anything.” “No! You-Know-Who killed Hermione!” She was hardly aware of what she was saying, that she hadn’t screened the room against who might be listening. “Not you! No matter what else you could’ve done, it’s not you who killed her, it was Voldemort! If you can’t believe that you’ll go mad, Harry!” “That’s not how responsibility works, Professor.” Harry’s voice was pa- tient, like he was explaining things to a child who was certain not to un- derstand. He wasn’t looking at her any more, just staring off at the wall to her right side. “When you do a fault analysis, there’s no point in assigning fault to a part of the system you can’t change afterwards, it’s like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time. There’s no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren’t going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame your- self, because you’re the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. That’s why Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands. He understands that part, at least.” Some distant part of her mind made a note to wait until much later and then speak sharply to the Headmaster about what he was showing to impressionable young children. She might even scream at him this time. She’d been thinking about screaming at him anyway, because of Miss Granger— “You’re not responsible,” she said, though her voice trembled. “It’s the Professors—it’s us who are responsible for student safety, not you.” Harry’s eyes flicked back to her. “You’re responsible?” There was a tight- ness in the voice. “You want me to hold you responsible, Professor McGon- agall?” She raised her chin and nodded. It would be better, by far, than Harry blaming himself. The boy pushed himself up from where he was sitting on the floor, and took a step forward. “All right, then,” Harry said in a monotone. “I tried to do the sensible thing, when I saw Hermione was missing and that none of the Professors knew. I asked for a seventh-year student to go with me on a broomstick and protect me while we looked for Hermione. I asked for help. I begged for help. And nobody helped me. Because you gave every- one an absolute order to stay in one place or they’d be expelled, no excuses. No matter what else Dumbledore gets wrong, he at least thinks of his stu- dents as people, not animals that have to be herded into a pen and kept from wandering out. You knew you weren’t any good at military think- ing, your first idea was to have us walking through the hallways, you knew some students there were better than you at strategy and tactics, and you still nailed us down in one room without any discretionary judgement. So when something you didn’t foresee happened and it would’ve made perfect sense to send out a seventh-year student on a fast broom to look for Hermione Granger, the students knew you wouldn’t understand or forgive. They weren’t afraid of the troll, they were afraid of you. The dis- cipline, the conformity, the cowardice that you instilled in them delayed me just long enough for Hermione to die. Not that I should’ve tried ask- ing for help from normal people, of course, and I will change and be less stupid next time. But if I were dumb enough to allocate responsibility to someone who isn’t me, that’s what I’d say.” Tears were streaming down her cheeks. “That’s what I’d tell you if I thought you could be responsible for any- thing. But normal people don’t choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. There’s a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll roaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian would or- der students not to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the little pic- ture of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can’t learn from experience or change herself, so there isn’t any point to this conversation. People like you aren’t responsible for anything, people like me are, and when we fail there’s no-one else to blame.” The boy strode forward to stand directly before her. His hand darted beneath his robes, brought forth the golden sphere that was the Ministry- issued protective shell of his Time-Turner. He spoke in a dead, level voice without any emphasis. “This could’ve saved Hermione, if I’d been able to use it. But you thought it was your role to shut me down and get in my way. Nobody has died in Hogwarts in fifty years, you said that when you locked it, do you remember? I should’ve asked again after Bellatrix Black got loose from Azkaban, or after Hermione got framed for attempted murder. But I forgot because I was stupid. Please unlock it now before any of my other friends die.” Unable to speak, she brought forth her wand and did so, releasing the time-keyed enchantment she’d laced into the shell’s lock. Harry Potter flipped open the golden shell, looked at the tiny glass hourglass within its circles, nodded, and then snapped the case shut. “Thank you. Now go away.” The boy’s voice cracked again. “I have to think.” 1521 CH APTER 9 0 It was perhaps half an hour later. The boy still guarded the door to where his best friend’s body lay, keeping his vigil. He was staring down- ward, at his wand as it lay in his hands. Sometimes his face screwed up in thought, at other times it relaxed. Although the door did not open, and there was no sound, the boy looked up. He composed his face. His voice, when he spoke, was dull. “I don’t want company.” The door opened. The Defence Professor of Hogwarts entered into the room and shut the door behind him, taking up careful position in a corner between two walls, as far away from the boy as the room permitted. A sharp sense of catastrophe had risen in the air between the two of them, and hung there unchanging. “Why are you here?” said the boy. The man tilted his head slightly. Pale eyes examined the boy as though he were a specimen of life from a distant planet, and correspondingly dan- gerous. “I’ve come to apologize, Mr Potter,” the man said quietly. “Apologize for what?” the boy said. “Why, what could you have done to prevent Hermione’s death?” “I should have thought to check for the presence of yourself, Mr Long- bottom, and Miss Granger, all of whom were obvious next targets,” the Defence Professor said without hesitation. “Mr Hagrid was not mentally equipped to command the student contingent. I should have ignored the Deputy Headmistress’s request for silence, and told her to leave behind Professor Flitwick, who would have been better able to defend the stu- dents from any threat, and who could have maintained communication via Patronus.” “Correct.” The boy’s voice was razor-sharp. “I’d forgotten there was someone else in Hogwarts who could be responsible for things. So why didn’t you think of it, Professor? Because I don’t believe that you were stupid.” There was a pause, and the boy’s fingers whitened on his wand. “You did not think of it either, Mr Potter, at the time.” There was a weariness in the Defence Professor’s voice. “I am smarter than you. I think faster than you. I am more experienced than you. But the gap between the two of us is not the same as the gap between us and them. If you can miss something, then so can I.” The man’s lips twisted. “You see, I deduced at once that the troll was but a distraction from some other matter, and of no great importance in itself. So long as nobody sent the students wan- dering pointlessly through the halls, or uncaringly dispatched the young Slytherins to those very dungeons where the troll had been spotted.” The boy did not seem to relax. “I suppose that is plausible.” “In any case,” said the man, “if there is anyone who can be said to be responsible for Miss Granger’s death, it is myself, not you. It is I, not you, who should have—” “I perceive that you have spoken to Professor McGonagall and that she has given you a script to follow.” The boy did not bother keeping the bitter- ness from his voice. “If you have something to say to me, Professor, say it without the masks.” There was a pause. “As you wish,” the Defence Professor said emotionlessly. The pale eyes stayed keen and sharp. “I do regret that the girl is dead. She was a good student in my Defence class, and could have been an ally to you later. I would wish to console you for your loss, but I cannot see how to go about doing so. Naturally, if I find the ones responsible I shall kill them. You are welcome to join in should circumstances permit.” “How touching,” the boy said, his voice cool. “You are not claiming to have liked Hermione, then?” “Her charms were lost on me, I suspect. I no longer form such bonds easily.” The boy nodded. “Thank you for being honest. Is that all, Professor?” There was a pause. “The castle is scarred, now,” said the man standing in the corner. “What?” “When a certain ancient device in my possession informed me that Miss Granger was on the verge of death, I cast that spell of cursed fire of which I once spoke. I burned through some walls and floors so that my broomstick could take a more direct path.” The man still spoke tonelessly. “Hogwarts will not heal such wounds easily, if at all. I suppose it will be necessary to patch over the holes with lesser conjurations. I regret that now, since I was in any case too late.” “Ah,” said the boy. He closed his eyes briefly. “You did want to save her. You wanted it so strongly that you made some sort of actual effort. I suppose your mind, if not theirs, would be capable of that.” A brief, dry smile from the man. “Thank you for that, Professor. But I would like to be left alone now until dinner time. You of all people will understand. Is that all?” “Not quite,” the man said. A tinge of sardonic dryness now returned to his voice. “You see, based on recent experiences, I am concerned that you may now intend to do something extremely foolish.” “Such as what?” said the boy. “I am not quite sure. Perhaps you have decided that a universe without Miss Granger is devoid of value, and should be destroyed for the insults it has dealt you.” The boy smiled without any humour. “Your own issues are showing, Professor. I don’t really go in for that sort of thing. Did you, at some point?” “Not particularly. I have no great fondness for the universe, but I do live there.” There was a pause. “What are you planning, Mr Potter?” said the man in the corner. “You have come to some significant resolution, though you are trying to hide it from me. What do you now intend?” The boy shook his head. “I’m still thinking, and would like to be left alone to do it.” “I recall an offer you once made to me, some months ago,” said the Defence Professor. “Do you want someone intelligent to talk to? I will un- derstand if you are not pleasant to be around.” The boy shook his head again. “No, thank you.” “Well, then,” said the Defence Professor. “What about someone who is powerful and not particularly bound by naive scruples?” There was a hesitation, and then the boy once more shook his head. “Someone who is knowledgeable of much secret lore, and magics that some might consider to be unnatural?” There was a slight narrowing of the boy’s eyes, so imperceptible that someone else might not have— “I see,” said the Defence Professor. “Go ahead and ask me about it, then. I give you my word that I will repeat nothing of it to the others.” The boy took a while to speak, and when he did it was in a cracked voice. “I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn’t an afterlife, and I’m not about to just let her—just not be—” The boy pressed his hands over his face, and when he withdrew them, he once more seemed as dispassionate as the man standing in the corner. The Defence Professor’s eyes were abstract, and faintly puzzled. “How?” the man said finally. “However I have to.” There was another pause. “Regardless of the risks,” the man in the corner said. “Regardless of how dangerous the magic required to accomplish it.” “Yes.” The Defence Professor’s eyes were thoughtful. “But what general ap- proach did you have in mind? I presume that turning her corpse into an Inferius is not what you—” “Would she be able to think?” the boy said. “Would her body still de- cay?” “No, and yes.” “Then no.” “What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could be ob- tained for you?” The boy shook his head. “I don’t want an illusion of Hermione drawn from my memories. I want her to be able to live her life—” the boy’s voice cracked. “I haven’t decided yet on an object-level angle of attack. If I have to brute-force the problem by acquiring enough power and knowledge to just make it happen, I will.” Another pause. “And to go about that,” the man in the corner said, “you will use your favourite tool, science.” “Of course.” The Defence Professor exhaled, almost like a sigh. “I suppose that makes sense of it.” “Are you willing to help, or not?” the boy said. “What help do you seek?” “Magic. Where does it come from?” “I do not know,” said the man. “And neither does anyone else?” “Oh, the situation is far worse than that, Mr Potter. There is hardly a scholar of the esoteric who has not unravelled the nature of magic, and every one of them believes something different.” “Where do new spells come from? I keep reading about someone who invented a spell to do something-or-other but there’s no mention of how.” A shrug of robed shoulders. “Where do new books come from, Mr Pot- ter? Those who read many books sometimes become able to write them in turn. How? No-one knows.” “There are books on how to write—” “Reading them will not make you a famous playwright. After all such advice is accounted for, what remains is mystery. The invention of new spells is a similar mystery of purer form.” The man’s head tilted. “Such endeavours are dangerous. The saying is that one should either not have children, or else wait until after they are grown. There is a reason why so many innovators seem to hail from Gryffindor, rather than Ravenclaw as might be expected.” “And the more powerful sorts of magics?” the boy said. “A legendary wizard might invent one sacrificial ritual in his life, and pass on the knowledge to his heirs. To try inventing five such would be suicide. That is why wizards of true power are those who have acquired ancient lore.” The boy nodded distantly. “So much for the direct solution, then. It would’ve been nice to just invent a spell for ‘Raise Dead’, ‘Become God’ or ‘Summon Terminal’. Do you know anything about Atlantis?” “Only what any scholar knows,” the man said dryly. “If you would like to hear about the top eighteen standard theories—do not glare at me, Mr Potter. If it were that simple, I would have done it many years earlier.” “I understand. Sorry.” There was a time of silence. The Defence Professor’s gaze rested on the boy, the boy stared off seemingly at nothing. “There’s some magics I mean to learn. Spells I could’ve used earlier today, if I’d thought to study them beforehand.” The boy’s voice was cold. “Spells I’ll need, if this sort of thing goes on happening. Most I expect I can just look up. Some I expect I can’t.” The Defence Professor inclined his head. “I shall teach you almost any magic you wish to know, Mr Potter. I do have some limits, but you may always ask. But what specifically do you seek? You lack the raw power for the Killing Curse and most other spells deemed forbidden—” “That spell of cursed fire. I don’t suppose it’s a sacrificial ritual that even a child could use, if he dared?” The Defence Professor’s lips twitched. “It requires the permanent sac- rifice of a drop of blood; your body would be lighter by that drop of blood, from that day forward. Not the sort of thing one would wish to do often, Mr Potter. Strength of will is demanded for the cursed fire not to turn upon you and consume you; the usual practice is to first test one’s will in lesser trials. And although it is not a primary element of the ritual, I am afraid that it does require more magic than you shall possess for another few years.” “Pity,” the boy said. “It would’ve been nice to see the look on the en- emy’s face the next time they tried using a troll.” The Defence Professor inclined his head, his lips twitching again. “What about Memory Charms? The Weasley twins were acting oddly and the Headmaster said he thinks they’ve been Obliviated. It seems to be one of the enemy’s favourite tricks.” “Rule Eight,” said the Defence Professor. “Any technique which is good enough to defeat me once is good enough to learn myself.” The boy smiled humourlessly. “And I once heard about an adult casting Obliviate while she was almost completely drained, so it must not take too much magic to cast. It’s not even considered Unforgiveable, though I can’t imagine why not. If I could’ve made Mr Hagrid remember a different set of orders—” “It is not that straightforward,” said the Defence Professor. “You are not powerful enough to use the False Memory Charm, and even a simple Obliviation will stretch the edge of your current stamina. It is a danger- ous art, illegal to use without Ministry authorization, and I would caution you not to use it under circumstances where it would be inconvenient to accidentally erase ten years of someone’s life. I wish I could promise you that I would obtain one of those highly guarded tomes from the Depart- ment of Mysteries, and pass it to you beneath a disguised cover. But what I must actually tell you is that you will find the standard introductory text in the north-north-west stacks of the main Hogwarts library, filed under M.” “Seriously,” the boy said flatly. “Indeed.” “Thank you for your guidance, Professor.” “Your creativity has become a great deal more practical, Mr Potter, since I have known you.” “Thank you for the compliment.” The boy did not look up from where he was again gazing down at the wand held between his hands. “I would like to go back to thinking now. Please explain to them on my behalf what happens if I am disturbed.” 1529 CH APTER 9 0 1530 1531 CH APTER 9 1 1532 ROLES II Hours had passed now, in the infirmary section with its closed door and a body lying in state behind it. Harry went on staring at his wand, as it lay in his lap. At the tiny scratches and smudges on the eleven inches of holly, flaws he’d never looked closely enough to notice before. A quick mental calculation said there was no reason to worry since if this was six or seven months’ ac- cumulation of damage, then a standard lifetime wouldn’t wear away the wand entirely. At the time, he probably would’ve worried about his own Time-Turner being taken away if he’d just openly yelled out ‘Does anyone have a Time-Turner?’ into the Great Hall, but it would have been easy enough to pre-commit to, after lunch, finding someone to send Pro- fessor Flitwick a message two hours earlier and then Professor Flitwick could’ve just gone straight to Hermione, or sent her his raven Patronus, long before the troll was anywhere near her. Or might that alternate Harry have already learned it was too late—heard about Hermione’s death after lunch and before he could buy any messages sent backwards in time? Maybe a basic guideline of working with time travel was to make sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you hadn’t yet gone backwards. There was a tiny chemical burn now on the end of his wand, presumably from contacting the acid he’d partially Transfigured the troll’s brain into, but the wand seemed robust against losses of small amounts of wood. Really the concept of a ‘magic wand’ being required just got stranger the more you thought about it. Though if spells were always being invented in some mysterious way, new rituals being carved as new levers upon the unknown machine, it might just be that people just kept inventing rituals that involved wands, just like they invented phrases like ‘Wingardium Leviosa’. It really seemed like magic ought to be, in some sense, almost arbitrarily powerful, and it certainly would be convenient if Harry could just bypass whatever conceptual limitation prevented people from inventing spells like ‘Just Fix Everything Forever’, but somehow nothing was ever that easy where magic was concerned. Harry looked at his mechanical watch again, but it still wasn’t time. He’d attempted to cast the Patronus Charm, meaning to tell his Pa- tronus to go to Hermione Granger. Just in case it was all a lie, a False Memory Charm or one of the who-knew-how-many-ways that wizards could be made to close their eyes and dream. Just in case the real Hermi- one was alive and being held somewhere, despite his feeling her life as it left her. Just in case there was an afterlife and the True Patronus could reach it. The spell hadn’t worked though, so that particular test had failed to provide any evidence, leaving him with the previous, unfavourable prior. Time passed, and yet more time. From the outside you would’ve just seen a boy, sitting, staring at his wand with an abstracted gaze, looking at his watch every two minutes or so. The door to the infirmary section opened once again. The boy sitting there looked up with a deadly, chilling glare. Then the boy’s face cracked in dismay, and he scrambled to his feet. “Harry,” said the man in the button-down formal shirt and a black waistcoat thrown over it. His voice was hoarse. “Harry, what’s happen- ing? The Headmaster of your school—he showed up in those ridiculous robes at my office and told me that Hermione Granger was dead!” A moment later a woman followed the man into the room; she seemed less confused than the man, less bewildered and more frightened. “Dad,” the boy said thinly. “Mum. Yes, she’s dead. They didn’t tell you anything else?” “No! Harry, what’s happening?” There was a pause. The boy slumped back against the wall. “I c-can’t, I can’t, I can’t do this.” “I can’t pretend to be a little boy, I j-just don’t have the energy right now.” “Harry,” the woman said falteringly. “Harry—” “Dad, you know those fantasy books where the hero has to hide every- thing from his parents because they, they wouldn’t understand, they’d react stupidly and get in the hero’s way? It’s a plot device, right, so that the hero has to solve everything himself instead of telling his parents. P- please don’t be that plot device, Dad, or you either, Mum. Just…just don’t play that role. Don’t be the parents who won’t understand. D-don’t yell at me and give me parental demands I can’t follow. Because I’ve wandered into a bloody stupid fantasy novel and now Hermione’s—I j-just don’t have the energy to deal with it.” Slowly, as though his limbs were only half-animated, the man in the black waistcoat knelt down to where Harry was standing, so that his eyes were level with his son’s. “Harry,” the man said. “I need you to tell me ev- erything that has happened, right now.” The boy took a deep breath, swallowed. “They t-tell me the Dark Lord I defeated may still be alive. Like that’s not the p-plot of a hundred sod- ding books, right? So, it could also be that the Headmaster of my school, who’s the most powerful wizard in the world, has gone insane. And, and Hermione was framed for an attempted murder just before this, not that anyone would’ve told her parents about it or anything. The student she was framed for attempted-murdering was the son of Lucius Malfoy, who’s the most powerful politician in magical Britain, and used to be the Dark Lord’s number two. The Defence Professor position at this school has a curse on it, nobody ever lasts more than a year, they have a saying that the Defence Professor is always a suspect. This year the Defence Professor is secretly a mysterious wizard who opposed the Dark Lord during the last war and may or may not be evil himself. Also the Potions Master has been pining after Lily Potter for years and might be behind this whole thing for some twisted psychological reason.” The boy’s lips pressed together bitterly. “I think that’s most of the bloody stupid plot.” The man, who had listened to all this quietly, stood up. He put a gentle hand on the boy’s shoulder. “That’s enough, Harry,” he said. “I’ve heard enough. We’re leaving this school right now and taking you with us.” The woman was looking at the boy, her face asking a question. The boy gazed back at her and nodded. The woman’s voice was thin when she spoke. “They won’t let us, Michael.” “They have no legal right to stop us—” “Right? You’re Muggles,” said the boy, his smile a grimace. “You have as much standing in the magical British legal system as mice. No wizard is going to care about any arguments you make about rights, about fairness, they won’t even take the time to listen. You don’t have any power, see, so they don’t have to bother. No, Mum, I’m not smiling like this because I agree with their Muggle policies, I’m smiling because I disagree with your children policies.” “Then,” Professor Michael Verres-Evans said firmly, “we shall see what the real government has to say about that. I know an MP or three—” “They’ll say, you’re crazy, have a nice stay in this asylum. That’s as- suming the Ministry Obliviators don’t get to you first and erase your memories. They do that to Muggles a lot, I hear. I figure the real higher- ups in our government have formed some cosy accommodations of their own. Maybe they get a few healing Charms now and then, if someone important manages to get cancer.” The boy gave that twisted smile again. “And that’s the situation, Dad, as Mum already knows. They’d never have brought you here or told you anything, if there was a single thing you could do about it.” The man’s mouth opened but no words came out, as though he had been reading from a script which described what a concerned parent ought to do in this sort of situation, and this script had suddenly arrived at a blank spot. “Harry,” the woman said falteringly. The boy looked at her. “Harry, did something happen to you? You seem…different…” “Petunia!” the man said, his tongue apparently working once more. “Don’t say such things! He’s under stress, that’s all.” “Well, Mum, you see—” The boy’s voice cracked. “Are you sure you want this all at once, Mum?” The woman nodded, though she didn’t speak. “I’ve got…you know how that school psychiatrist thought I had anger management problems? Well—” The boy stopped, and swallowed. “I don’t know how to explain this to you, Mum. It’s something magical instead. Probably something to do with whatever happened on the night my par- ents died. I have…well, I was calling it a mysterious dark side and I know it sounds like a joke and I did check with…with an ancient telepathic mag- ical hat to make sure my scar wasn’t actually inhabited by the Dark Lord’s spirit and it said that there was only one person under its brim and I don’t think wizards have actual souls anyway since they can still suffer from brain damage, only—” “Harry, slow down!” said the man. “—only, only whatever it is, it’s still real, there’s something inside me, it gave me willpower when things were bad, I could face down anything so long as I was angry, Snape, Dumbledore, the entire Wizengamot, my dark side wasn’t afraid of anything but Dementors. And I wasn’t stupid, I knew that there might be a price for using my dark side and I kept on looking to see what the price might be. It didn’t change my magic, it didn’t seem to cause permanent alignment shift, it didn’t try to take me away from my friends or anything like that, so I kept on using it whenever I had to and I only figured out too late what the price really was—” The boy’s voice had become almost a whisper. “I only figured out today…every time I call on it…it uses up my childhood. I killed the thing that got Hermione. And it wasn’t my dark side that did it, it was me. Oh, Mum, Dad, I’m sorry.” There was a long silence filled with the sound of broken masks. “Harry,” the man said, kneeling down again, “I need you to start over from the beginning and explain that much more slowly.” The boy spoke. The parents listened. Some time later, the father stood up. The boy looked up at him, grimacing in bitter anticipation. “Harry,” the man said, “Petunia and I are going to get you out of here as quickly as possible—” “Don’t,” the boy said warningly. “I mean it, Dad. The Ministry of Magic isn’t something you can stand up to. Pretend they’re the tax office or the dean or something else that won’t brook any challenge to their dominance. In magical Britain you’re only allowed to remember what the government thinks you should remember, and remembering the existence of magic or that you have a son named Harry is a privilege, not a right. And if they did that I’d crack and turn the Ministry into a giant flaming crater. Mum, you know the score, you absolutely have to stop Dad from trying anything stupid.” “And son—” The man rubbed at his temples. “Maybe I shouldn’t say this now…but are you sure that what you’re talking about is really a magical dark side, and not something normal for a boy your age?” “Normal,” the boy said with elaborate patience. “Normal how, exactly? I could check again, but I’m reasonably sure there wasn’t anything about this in Childcraft: A Guide For Parents. My dark side isn’t just an emotional state, it makes me smarter. In some ways, anyhow. You can’t just pretend yourself smarter.” The man rubbed at his head again. “Well…there’s a certain well-known phenomenon wherein children undergo a biological process which can sometimes make them angry and dark and grim, and this process also significantly increases their intelligence and their height—” The boy slumped back against the wall. “No, Dad, it’s not that I’m turn- ing into a teenager. I checked with my brain and it still thinks that girls are icky. But if that’s what you want to pretend, then fine. Maybe I’m bet- ter off with you not believing me. I just—” The boy’s voice choked. “I just couldn’t stand lying about it.” “Adolescence doesn’t necessarily work like that, Harry. It may still take a while for you to notice girls. If, in fact, you haven’t noticed one alrea—” and the man abruptly stopped. “I didn’t like Hermione in that way,” the boy whispered. “Why does everyone keep thinking it has to be about that? It’s disrespectful to her, to think someone could only like her in that way.” The man swallowed visibly. “Anyway, son, you keep yourself safe while we work on getting you out of here, is that understood? Don’t you go ac- tually thinking that you’ve turned to the dark side. I know you’ve had, ah, what I used to call your Ender Wiggin moments—” “I think we are now well past Ender and on to Ender after the buggers kill Valentine.” “Language!” said the woman, and then her hand flew to cover her mouth. The boy spoke wearily. “Not that kind of bugger, Mum. They’re insec- toid aliens—never mind.” “Harry, that’s exactly what I’m saying you shouldn’t think,” Professor Verres-Evans said firmly. “You’re not to go believing that you’re turning evil. You are not to hurt anyone, place yourself in harm’s way, or mess around with any sort of black magic whatsoever, while your Mum and I work on extracting you from this situation. Is that clear, son?” The boy closed his eyes. “That’d be wonderful advice, Dad, if only I were in a comic book.” “Harry—” the man began. “Police can’t do that. Soldiers can’t do that. The most powerful wizard in the world couldn’t do that, and he tried. It’s not fair to the innocent bystanders to play at being Batman if you can’t actually protect everyone under that code. And I’ve just proven that I can’t.” Beads of sweat were glistening on Professor Michael Verres-Evans’s forehead. “Now you listen to me. No matter what you’ve read in books, you aren’t supposed to be protecting anyone! Or involving yourself in anything dangerous! Absolutely anything dangerous whatsoever! Just stay out of the way of everything, every bit of craziness going on in this madhouse, while we get you out of here the first instant we possibly can!” The boy looked searchingly at his father, then his mother. Then he looked at his wristwatch again. “Excellent point,” said the boy. The boy marched over to the door leading outward, and flung it open. 1539 CH APTER 9 1 1540 ROLES II 1541 CH APTER 9 1 When the door opened again, Harry seemed to have changed, as though that minute and a half had passed over the course of lifetimes. “Seal up the room,” Harry said quietly, “and let’s go, Professor McGon- agall.” She walked over to the storeroom door. She wasn’t quite able to stop herself from looking in, and saw the dried blood, the sheet covering the lower half, the upper body waxy and doll-like, and a glimpse of Hermione Granger’s closed eyes. Something inside her began its weeping all over again. She closed the door. Her fingers moved upon her wand, her mouth spoke words without thought, Charms and wards to seal the room against entry. “Professor McGonagall,” Harry said in a strange voice, as if by rote, “do you have the rock? The rock that the Headmaster gave me? I should Transfigure it into a jewel again, since it did prove useful.” Automatically her eyes went to the ring on Harry’s left pinky finger, noting the emptiness of the setting where the jewel should have been. “I shall mention it to the Headmaster,” her tongue replied. “Is that a usual tactic, by the way?” Harry said, voice still odd. “Car- rying something large Transfigured into something small to use as a weapon? Or is that a usual exercise for Transfiguration practice?” Distantly, she shook her head. “Well, let’s go, then.” “I have—” her voice stopped. “I’m afraid I have something else which I must do, now. Will you be all right on your own, and will you promise to go to the Great Hall directly and eat something, Mr Potter?” The boy promised (barring exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, a clause with which she did not argue) and then walked out of the room. What lay ahead of her…would be no easier, certainly, and might well be harder. 1543 1545 CH APTER 9 2 1546 ROLES III 1547 CH APTER 9 2 “How is Mr Potter doing?” demanded Professor Quirrell. There was a tension about the man, you could not quite call it concern, more like an ambusher measuring the time to strike. The Grangers had hardly left with Madam Pomfrey before the Defence Professor had knocked upon the door to her office and then entered without waiting for her answer, and spoken before she could say a word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter had picked up that habit from his Defence Professor, being unaware of others’ pain when there was something else on his mind, or if it was only a childish flaw which this man had somehow failed to grow out of. “Mr Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger’s body,” she said, putting some of the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain that the Defence Professor was not experiencing as much grief as she was, the man had spoken not a single word of Hermione Granger. For him to put demands on her—“I believe he has gone down to dinner.” “I am not asking after the boy’s physical state! Have you—has he—” Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though to indicate a concept for which he had no words. “Not particularly,” she said. She was around thirty seconds away from ordering the Defence Professor out of her office. Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of her of- fice. “Miss Granger was the only one whose worries he truly heeded— with her gone—all checks on the boy’s recklessness are removed. I see it now. Who else is there? Mr Longbottom? Mr Potter does not pretend that they are peers. Flitwick? His goblin blood would only cry for vengeance. Mr Malfoy, if he were returned? To what end? Snape? A walking disas- ter. Dumbledore? Pfah. Events are already set for catastrophe, they must be steered along some course they would not naturally go. Who might Mr Potter heed, who would not ordinarily speak to him? Cedric Diggory has taught him, but what would Mr Diggory say in advice? An unknown. Mr Potter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin. To him I have paid lit- tle heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, the act which must be done, the sacrifice which must be made to change the boy’s course?” Pro- fessor Quirrell whirled on her. “Did Remus Lupin comfort those in grief or stay those moved to rash deeds, during his time with the Order of the Phœnix?” “It is not a poor thought,” she said slowly. “I believe that Mr Lupin was often a voice of restraint to James Potter in his Hogwarts days.” “James Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing. “The boy is not much like James Potter. Are you confident in the success of this plan? No, that is the wrong question, we are not limited to a single plan. Are you certain that this plan will be enough, that we need essay no others? Asked in such fashion, the question answers itself. The path leading to disaster must be averted along every possible point of intervention.” The Defence Professor had resumed pacing the confines of her office, reaching one wall, turning on his heel, pacing to the other. “My apologies, Professor,” she did not bother keeping the sharpness from her voice, “but I have quite reached my limits for the day. You may go.” “You.” Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself gazing directly into eyes of icy blue. “You would be the first one I would think of after Miss Granger, to stay the boy from a folly. Have you already done your utmost? Of course you have not.” How dare he suggest that. “If you have nothing more to say, Professor, then you will go.” “Has your confederacy deduced who I really am?” The words were spo- ken with deceptive mildness. “Yes, in fact. Now—” Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of lightning, like a thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened her other senses, the papers on her desk blown aside not by any conjured wind but by the sheer raw force of arcane might. Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger’s death cer- tificates drifting down through the air to the floor. “I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort,” the man said, still in mild tones. “Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to continue in this state of mind. He will become dangerous. It is possible that you have already done everything you can. Yet I find this a very rare event indeed, and more often said than done. I suspect rather that you have only done what you customarily do. I cannot truly comprehend what drives others to break their bounds, since I never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when faced with the prospect of death. Fear of public ridicule or losing one’s livelihood is more likely to drive men to extremes and the breaking of their customary habits. On the other side of the war, the Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse, judiciously used on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment except by success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine their state of mind within your- self, and ask yourself whether you have truly done all that you can to wrench Harry Potter from his course.” “I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear,” she snapped back. “You will exercise courtesy within my office!” “I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that moves me now. You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by certain bound- aries. It is my professional judgement, speaking as a learned wizard almost on par with Dumbledore or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that the boy could join the ranks of those whose rituals are inscribed upon the tombstones of countries. This is not an idle worry, McGonagall, I have already heard words to produce the gravest apprehensions.” “Are you mad? You think that Mr Potter could—this is ridiculous. Mr Potter cannot possibly—” A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel ball. “—Mr Potter would not do such a thing!” “His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out to invoke their own dooms. Mr Potter may not strike you as malicious. Does he strike you as reckless once he is resolved upon a goal? I say again that I have specific reason for the gravest possible concerns!” “Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?” she said slowly. “That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach the boy. At best he is wise enough to know this and make things no worse. I lack the requisite frame of mind. You are the one who—but I see that you still look for others to save you.” The Defence Professor turned from her, and strode to the door. “I think I shall consult with Severus Snape. The man may be a walking disaster, but he knows the fact, and he may possess a greater understanding of that boy’s mood. As for you, madam, imagine yourself at the end of your life, knowing that Britain—but no, Britain is not your true country, is it? Imagine yourself at the end of your life as the darkness eats through the fading walls of Hogwarts, knowing that your students will die with you, remembering this day and realizing there was something else you could have done.” CHAPTER NINET Y-THREE ROLES, PART I V Harry had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once, grabbed enough calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on his Cloak again and found a small random corner in which to eat. Seeing the students at their tables— Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a good sign, Huf- flepuff said. It’s not reasonable to blame them for having not had your oppor- tunities to learn what you’ve learned. Inaction in emergencies has nothing to do with people being selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in Tener-something where a few people ran out and escaped but most people just sat in their seats not moving while their plane was literally on fire. Look at how long you took to really start moving. It serves no useful purpose to hate, said Gryffindor. It’s just going to damage your altruism. Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent this from happen- ing next time, said Ravenclaw. I’ll go ahead and register the experimental prediction, said Slytherin, that we’ll always observe exactly what would be predicted on the hypothesis that people cannot be saved, cannot be taught, and will never help us with anything important. Also, we need some way of keeping track of all the times I’m right. Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of toast as fast as he could. It wasn’t proper nutrition as a general policy, but one-time exceptions wouldn’t hurt so long as he made them up the next day. In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phœnix flew in from nowhere and said, in the voice of a tired old man, “Please remove your Cloak, Harry, I have a letter to deliver to you.” Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone down the wrong way, stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility, said aloud “Tell Dumbledore I said fine,” and then sat down and continued to eat his toast. The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up to Harry’s nook, carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real paper, with lines, not wizard’s parchment. “Is that—” Harry said. “From your father, and from your mother,” said the old wizard. Word- lessly, Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and wordlessly Harry accepted them. The old wizard hesitated, then said quietly, “The Defence Professor has told me to restrain my counsel, and I thought the same thing myself when given time to think. I have always taken too long to learn the virtues of silence. But if I am mistaken, you need only say the word—” “You’re not mistaken,” Harry said. He looked down at the folded, lined papers, feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body indicated a strong pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn’t actually disown him, and there wasn’t much they could do to him (some part of himself was still afraid in a very visceral way of television privileges being taken away, no matter how little sense that made now). But he had stepped outside the role that parents would expect of children who, in their internal beliefs, were lower on the pecking order. It would be stupid to expect anything except complete indignant fury, all-out righteous rage, when you acted like that to someone who thought they were dominant over you. “After you read it,” the Headmaster said, “I believe that you should come to the Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an announcement which you will wish to hear.” “I’m not interested in funerals—” “No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done reading, and do so without your Cloak. Will you?” “Yes.” The old wizard left. Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important thing was keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of harm’s way, it might be a cliche but so far as Harry could tell the logic was valid. Dam- aged relationships could be repaired later. The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a careful focus for Harry to read, Son, No matter what you’ve read in books, keeping us out of harm’s way is not as important as having adults who can help when you’re in trouble. You decided without allowing us a w ord in edgeways that we’d abandon you because of your ‘dark side’. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I’ve seen things in this last year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy—sometimes I w onder if your Mum isn’t just humouring me and the authorities took you away when I started thinking you were a magic-user—so I can’t deny that it’s possible you’ve managed to develop some…I’m not quite sure what to call it, but ‘dark side’ seems premature if we don’t know what’s happening. Are you sure it’s not a burgeoning telepathic talent and you’re just picking up on the minds of other wizards around you? Their thoughts might seem evil to a child who grew up in a saner civilization. These are ungrounded speculations, I admit, but you shouldn’t jump to conclusions either. The tw o most important things I have to tell you are this. First, son, I have every confidence in your ability to stay on the L ight Side of the Force so long as you choose to, and I have every confidence that you will choose to. If there’s some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions in your ears, just ignore the suggestions. I do feel the need to emphasize that you should exercise special caution to ignore this evil spirit even if it is suggesting what seem like w onderful creative ideas and I hope I do not need to remind you about the Incident with the Science Project which w ould, I admit, make a deal more sense if you were struggling with demonic possession. The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to fear that Mum or I are going to abandon you because of your ‘dark side’. We may not have expected you to gain magical powers or develop an affinity for black magic, but we did expect you to become a teenager. Which, if you think about it from your poor father’s perspective, is already a sufficiently w orrying prospect regarding a child who, by the age of nine, had been party to the summoning of a total of five fire engines. Children grow up. I w on’t lie to you and say that you will feel as close to us at 20 as you do now. But your Mum and I will feel just as close to you when we are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home robots. Children always grow up and away from their parents, and the parents always follow them from behind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up, and their personalities change, and they do things that their parents wish they w ould not do, and they act disrespectfully toward their parents and have them hauled out of their magical schools, and the parents go on loving them anyway. It is Nature’s way. Though in the event that you have not yet hit puberty and your teenage years are proportionately w orse than this, we reserve the right to reconsider this sentiment. No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and will always love you no matter what. I don’t know if our love has any magical power under your rules, but if it does, don’t hesitate to call on it. With all of this said…Harry, what you did there is not acceptable. I think you know that. And I also know that it is not the time to lecture you on it. But you must write and tell us what is happening. I can understand very well why you’d want us taken out of your school at once, and I know we can’t force you to do anything, but please, Harry, be reasonable and realize how terrified we must be. I w ould like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden to mess around with any magic that the adults around you consider the least bit unsafe, but for all I know, the teachers at your school are giving everyone lessons in advanced necromancy every Monday. Please, please exercise as much caution as your situation permits, whatever your situation may be. Despite your very hurried summary we don’t have the slightest idea what is happening and I hope that you w ill write us as much as you can. It is clear that you are, at least in some ways, growing up, and I will try not to act like the children’s-book parent who only makes things w orse—though I hope you appreciate how hard this is—and your Mum has said a number of frightening things to me about how wizardry stays secret and how I might get you into trouble by making waves. I cannot tell you to avoid anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and your Headmaster will not let you leave. I can’t tell you that you shouldn’t take responsibility for anything happening around you, because for all I know there are other children in trouble. But remember that it is not your moral responsibility to protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and every good adult w ould agree with that. Please write and tell us more as soon as you can. Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at all that we can do, please let us know at once. There is nothing which can happen to us which w ould be w orse than learning that something had happened to you. L ove, Dad. The last page said only, You promised me that you w ouldn’t let magic take you away from me. I didn’t raise you to be a boy who w ould break a promise to his Mum. You must come back safely, because you promised. L ove, Mum. Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the Great Hall. His hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and it seemed to be taking a very great deal of effort not to cry; which he knew word- lessly that he must not do. He hadn’t cried through all of the day. And he wouldn’t cry. Crying was the same as admitting defeat. And this wasn’t over. So he wouldn’t cry. 1558 ROLES I V 1559 CH APTER 9 3 There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the Gryffin- dor Table, as Harry’s heart froze within his chest. Harry needed to run forward, say something, he hadn’t meant for this to— 1560 ROLES I V “Stop!” Harry screamed, and then, again, “Stop.” The word sticking in his throat. “You don’t have to, Professor.” Something inside him was twist- ing, threatening to split him open, like a giant’s hands wrenching at him to tear him in half. “And, and you shouldn’t forget Susan Bones, and Ron Weasley—they also helped, they should get House points too—” “Miss Bones and the young Weasley?” said Professor McGonagall. “Rubeus said nothing of that—what did they do?” “Miss Bones tried to stun Mr Hagrid when he tried to stop me, and Mr Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop me. They should both get points, and, and so should Neville,” Harry hadn’t thought to imagine it before, the way Neville must be feeling now, but the instant he’d thought, he knew, “because Neville tried to do something, even if it wasn’t the right thing, doing what’s right is the second lesson, you can start practising that after you learn to do anything at all—” “Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice breaking in the middle. “Ten points to Gryffindor, Ron Weasley, your family has done itself exceeding proud, this day. And ten points to Hufflepuff for Neville Longbottom, for standing up to Mr Potter and do- ing what he thought was right—” “You shouldn’t!” screamed a young voice from the Hufflepuff table, fol- lowed by a single choking sound. Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor McGon- agall and said, as steadily as he could, “Neville’s right, actually, you can’t award literally zero points for the part where you get the action correct, that sends the wrong message too, but he was halfway there so it could be five points instead.” Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn’t think of what to say; but then her eyes went to Neville’s place at the table, and she said, “As you wish, Mr Potter. What is it, Miss Bones?” Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward, wip- ing at her own eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, “Actually—Professor McGonagall—General Potter didn’t see it—but Captain Weasley and I weren’t the only ones who tried to get in Mr Hagrid’s way, after he ran out. Before some of the older students stopped us. But we managed to slow Mr Hagrid down a minute, so General Potter could get away.” “You’ve got to give them points too,” said Ron Weasley from the Gryf- findor table. “Or I won’t take any.” “Who else?” said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit unsteady. Seven other children stood up. What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting nothing would ever work? said Hufflepuff. Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his force to hold himself together. 1562 ROLES I V Just to make sure, said some part of Harry, while the rest of him sobbed into Professor McGonagall’s arms, this doesn’t mean we’ve accepted Hermi- one’s death, right? No said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in unanimous agree- ment, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel. Never, ever, forever. The Defence Professor watched them both, the woman and the crying boy. His eyes were very cold, and very calculating. He did not think that this would be enough. 1563 CH APTER 9 3 1564 1565 CH APTER 9 4 1566 ROLES V 1567 CH APTER 9 4 1568 ROLES V 1569 CH APTER 9 4 1570 ROLES V 1571 CH APTER 9 4 “By the way,” Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from Floo into the empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. “One last quick question I wanted to ask just you. That sword the Weasley twins pulled out of the Sorting Hat. That was the Sword of Gryffindor, wasn’t it?” The old wizard turned, face neutral. “What makes you think that, Harry?” “The Sorting Hat yelled Gryffindor! just before handing it out, the sword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade, and the Latin script said Nothing better. Just a hunch.” “Nihil supernum,” said the old wizard. “That is not quite what it means.” Harry nodded. “Mmhm. What’d you do with it?” “I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure place,” the old wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. “I hope you are not greedy for it yourself, young Ravenclaw.” “Not at all, just want to make sure you’re not keeping it permanently from its rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are the Heir of Gryffindor, then?” “The Heir of Gryffindor?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised. Then the old wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. “Ah, Harry, Salazar Slytherin may have built a Chamber of Secrets into Hogwarts, but Godric Gryffindor was not much given to such extravagances. We have seen only that Godric left his Sword to the defence of Hogwarts, if a worthy student ever faced a foe they could not defeat alone.” “That’s not the same as saying no. Don’t think I didn’t notice that you didn’t actually say no.” “I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all that Godric Gryffindor may or may not have done—” “Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective probability that there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and one or both Weasley twins are it. Yes or no, evasion means yes. You’re not going to succeed in distracting me, no matter how much I have to go to the bathroom.” The old wizard sighed. “Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the Heir of Gryffindor. I beg you not to speak of it to them, not yet.” Harry nodded, and turned to go. “I’m surprised,” Harry said. “I read a little about Godric Gryffindor’s historical life. The Weasley twins are… well, they’re awesome in various ways, but they don’t seem much like the Godric in the history books.” “Only a man exceedingly proud and vain,” Dumbledore said quietly, as he turned back to the Floo roaring up again with green flames, “would believe that his heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wished that he could be.” The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone. 1574 ROLES V 1575 1577 CH APTER 95 1578 ROLES V I Two hours later, after Harry had spun the Time-Turner once, noted down the exact time and memorized his exact location, spent another hour walking, went inside and told Professor McGonagall that he was cur- rently talking to the Defence Professor in the woods outside Hogwarts (just in case anything happened to him), walked for a further hour, then returned to his original location exactly one hour after he’d left and spun the Time-Turner again— 1579 CH APTER 95 1580 ROLES V I 1581 CH APTER 95 1582 ROLES V I 1583 CH APTER 95 1584 ROLES V I 1585 CH APTER 95 1586 ROLES V I 1587 CH APTER 95 1588 1589 CH APTER 9 6 Harry walked beside Mr Lupin toward the black marble obelisk, think- ing silently. It seemed to Harry that this adventure was essentially mis- guided; he had no use for grief counselling, that was not Harry’s chosen path. So far as Harry was concerned, the five stages of grief were Rage, Remorse, Resolve, Research, and Resurrection. (Not that the usual ‘five stages of grief’ had any experimental evidence whatsoever that Harry had ever heard about.) But Mr Lupin had seemed too sincere to refuse; and vis- iting James and Lily’s home was something Harry felt he ought not to turn down. So Harry walked, feeling oddly detached; walking silently through a play whose script he was not interested in reading. Harry had been told that he wasn’t to wear the Cloak of Invisibility for this journey, so that Mr Lupin could keep track of him. Harry was practically certain that Dumbledore, or both Dumbledore and Mad-Eye Moody, were following them invisibly to see if anyone tried for the bait. There was no way Harry would have been let out of Hogwarts with only Remus Lupin for a guard. Harry didn’t expect anything to hap- pen, though. He’d seen nothing to contradict the hypothesis that all the danger centred on Hogwarts and only Hogwarts. As the two of them walked closer toward the centre of town, the mar- ble obelisk transformed into— Harry drew in a breath. He’d been expecting a heroic pose of James Potter with wand levelled against Lord Voldemort, and Lily Potter with arms outstretched in front of the crib. Instead there was a man with untidy hair and glasses, and a woman with her hair let down and a baby in her arms, and that was all. “It looks very…normal,” Harry said, feeling an odd catch in his throat. “Madam Longbottom and Professor Dumbledore put their foot down hard,” said Mr Lupin, who was looking more at Harry than at the monu- ment. “They said that the Potters should be remembered as they had lived, not as they had died.” Harry looked at the statue, thinking. Very strange, to see himself as a baby of stone, with no scar upon his forehead. It was a glimpse at an alternate universe, one where Harry James Potter (no Evans-Verres to his name) became an intelligent but ordinary wizarding scholar, maybe Sorted into Gryffindor like his parents. A Harry Potter who grew up a proper young wizard, knowing little of science for all that his mother was Muggle-born. Ultimately changing…not much. James and Lily wouldn’t have raised their son with what Professor Quirrell would have called ambition and what Professor Verres-Evans would have called the common endeavour. His birth parents would have loved him very much, and that would not have been much help to anyone in the world except Harry. If someone had undone their death— “You were their friend,” Harry said, turning to look at Lupin. “For a long time, since you were children.” Mr Lupin nodded silently. Professor Quirrell’s voice resounded in Harry’s approximate memory: The most likely difference is not that you care more. Rather it is that, being a more logical creature than they, only you are aware that the role of Friend ought to require this of you… “When Lily and James died,” Harry said, “did you think at all of whether there might be some magical way to get them back? Like Orpheus and Eurydice? Or the, what was it, Elrin brothers?” “There is no magic which can undo death,” Mr Lupin said quietly. “There are some mysteries which wizardry cannot touch.” “Did you do a mental check of what you thought you knew, how you thought you knew it, and how high the probability was of that conclu- sion?” “What?” said Mr Lupin. “Could you repeat that, Harry?” “I’m saying, did you think about it anyway?” Mr Lupin shook his head. “Why not?” “Because it was already done, and over,” Remus Lupin said gently. “Be- cause wherever James and Lily are now, they would wish me to act for the sake of the living, not the dead.” Harry nodded silently. He’d been pretty sure of the answer to that question before he’d asked. He’d already read that script. But he’d asked anyway, just in case Mr Lupin had spent a week obsessing about it, be- cause Harry could have been wrong. The soft voice of the Defence Professor seemed to speak in Harry’s mind. Surely, if Lupin truly cared, he would not need special instruction for some- thing as simple as thinking for five minutes before giving up… Yes, he would, Harry answered the mental voice. Human beings wouldn’t suddenly obtain a skill like that just because they cared. I learned about it because I’d read library books, produced by a huge scientific edifice— And that other part of Harry said, in that soft voice, But there is also another hypothesis, Mr Potter, and it fits the data in a much less complicated way. No it doesn’t! How would people even know what to pretend, if nobody had ever cared? They don’t know. That is what you observe. The two of them walked onward toward a certain house, past a long row of occupied wizard cottages and other cottages overgrown with vines. Coming finally to the house with half its top blown off, and green leaves growing over into the inside; behind a shoulder-high wild-growing hedge lining the pavement, and a narrow metal gate (Mr Hagrid had prob- ably stepped right over it, being unable to fit through). The gap in the roof was like a giant mouth had taken a circular bite from the house, leaving spines of wood, what had maybe been support beams, sticking out. To the right side a single chimney still stood upright, uneaten by the giant bite, but leaning dangerously without its former support. Windows were shattered. Where there should have been a front door were only splinters of wood. To this place Lord Voldemort had come, silently, making less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement… Remus Lupin put a hand upon Harry’s shoulder. “Touch the gate,” Mr Lupin urged. Harry reached out a hand and did so. Like a fast-growing flower a sign burst from the tangled weeds in the ground behind the gate, a wooden sign with golden letters, and it said: On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives. They were survived by their son, Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to withstand the Killing Curse, the Boy-Who-Lived, who broke You-Know-Who’s power. This house has been left in its ruined state, as a monument to the Potters, as a reminder of their sacrifice. In a blank space below the golden letters were written other messages, dozens of them, magical ink that rose to the surface and gleamed brightly enough to be read before fading and giving way to other messages. So my Gideon is avenged. Thank you, Harry Potter. Fare well wherever you are. We will always be in the Potters’ debt. Oh James, oh Lily, I am sorry. I hope you’re alive, Harry Potter. There is always a price. I wish our last words had been kinder, James. I’m sorry. There is always a dawn after the night. Rest well, Lily. Bless you, Boy-Who-Lived. You were our miracle. “I guess—” Harry said. “I guess that’s what people do—instead of try- ing to make it better—” Harry stopped. The thought seemed unworthy of this place. He looked up, and saw Remus Lupin gazing at him with a look so gentle that Harry wrenched his eyes away to the blasted and broken roof. You were our miracle. Harry had always heard the word ‘miracle’ in the context of how, in the natural universe, there was no such thing. And yet looking at the ruined house, he suddenly knew exactly what the word meant, the note of grace all unexplained, the blessing inexplicable. The Dark Lord had almost won, and then in one night all the darkness and ter- ror had ended, salvation without justification, a sudden dawn from out of the darkness and even now nobody knew why— If Lily Potter had lived beyond her confrontation with Lord Voldemort, she would have felt that way when she saw her baby alive, afterwards. “Let’s go,” whispered the baby boy, ten years later. They went. At the entrance to the graveyard was a kissing gate. Remus took out his wand (Harry was already holding his) and there was a brief blur as they stepped through. Some of the stones rising up from the ground looked as old as the wall in Oxford that his father had said was around a thousand years old. Hallie Fleming, said the first stone that Harry saw, in a carving almost invisibly faded with the erosion of time. Vienna Wood, said another. It had been a long time since Harry had visited a graveyard. His mind had still been childlike the last time he’d come to one, long before he’d seen within Death’s shadow. Coming here now was…strange, and sad, and puzzling, and this has been happening for so long, why haven’t wizards tried to stop it, why aren’t they putting all their strength into that like Muggles do with medical research, only more so, wizards have more reason to hope… “The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow too?” Harry said, as they walked past a pair of relatively new stones saying Kendra Dumbledore and Ariana Dumbledore. “For a long, long time,” Mr Lupin said. They walked further into the graveyard, far toward the end, past many deaths that had been mourned. Then Mr Lupin pointed at a linked double headstone, of marble still white and unaged. “Are there going to be messages there?” Harry said. He didn’t want to deal any more with the way that other people dealt with death. Mr Lupin shook his head. They walked toward the linked white stones. And stood before— “What is this?” Harry whispered. “Who…who wrote this?” JAMES POTTER BORN 27 MARCH 1960 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 “Wrote what?” said Mr Lupin, puzzled. LILY POTTER BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 “This!” Harry cried. “The inscription!” There were tears welling up in Harry’s eyes, at the brightness out of place and unexplained, the touch of grace where no grace should have been, the mysterious blessing, tears welling up at THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE DESTROYED IS DEATH “That?” Mr Lupin said. “That’s the…motto, I suppose you could call it, of the Potters. Though I don’t think it was ever something as formal as that. Just a saying handed down from long, long ago…” “This—that—” Harry scrambled down to kneel beside the grave, touched the inscription with a trembling hand. “How? Things like that can’t just be, be genetic—” Then Harry saw what tears had blurred, the faint carving of a line, within a circle, within a triangle. The symbol of the Deathly Hallows. And Harry understood. “They tried,” Harry whispered. The three Peverell brothers. Had they lost someone precious to them, was that where it had begun? “With all their lives, they tried, and they made progress—” The Cloak of Invisibility, that could defeat the Dementors’ sight. “—but their research wasn’t finished—” Hiding from Death’s shadow is not defeating Death itself. The Resurrection Stone couldn’t really bring anyone back. The Elder Wand couldn’t protect you from old age. “—so they passed on the mission to their children, and their children’s children.” Generation after generation. Until it came to me. Could Time echo like that, rhyming, between this far into the future, and that far in the past? It couldn’t be coincidence, could it? Not this mes- sage, not in this place. My family. You really were, my mother and my father. “It doesn’t mean resurrecting the dead, Harry,” Mr Lupin said. “It means accepting death, and so being beyond death, mastering it.” “Did James tell you that?” Harry said, his voice strange. “No,” said Mr Lupin, “but—” “Good.” Harry rose up slowly from where he had been kneeling, feeling as though he were pushing up a sun upon his shoulders, raising the dawn above the horizon. Of course other wizards have tried. I am not unique. I was never alone. These feelings in my heart, they’re not so special, not in the wizard world or the Muggle one. “Harry, your wand!” There was a sudden excitement in Mr Lupin’s voice, and when Harry raised his wand to look at it closely, he saw that it was gleaming ever so faintly with a silver light, welling out of the wood. “Cast the Patronus Charm!” urged Mr Lupin. “Try casting it again, Harry!” Oh, right. So far as Mr Lupin knows, I can’t— Harry smiled, and even laughed a little. “I’d better not,” Harry said. “If I tried to cast the spell in this state of mind, it’d probably kill me.” “What?” said Mr Lupin. “The Patronus Charm doesn’t do that!” Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres raised his left hand, still laughing, and wiped away some more tears. “You know, Mr Lupin,” Harry said, “it really takes a baroque interpre- tation to think that somebody would be walking around, pondering how death is just something we all have to accept, and communicate their state of mind by saying, ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.’ Maybe someone else thought it sounded poetic and picked up the phrase and tried to interpret it differently, but whoever said it first didn’t like death much.” Sometimes it puzzled Harry how most people didn’t seem to even notice when they were twisting something around to the exact opposite of its obvious reading. It couldn’t be a raw brainpower thing, people could see the obvious reading of most other English sentences. “Also ‘shall be destroyed’ refers to a change of future state, so it can’t be about the way things are now.” Remus Lupin was staring at him with wide eyes. “You certainly are James and Lily’s child,” the man said, sounding rather shocked. “Yes, I am,” Harry said. But that wasn’t enough, he had to do some- thing more, so Harry raised his wand in the air and said, his voice as steady as he could make it, “I am Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the son of Lily and James, of the house of Potter, and I accept my family’s quest. Death is my enemy, and I will defeat it.” Thrayen beyn Peverlas soona ahnd thrih heera toal thissoom Dath bey yewoo- nen. “What?” Harry said aloud. The words had popped up into his stream of consciousness as though from his own thoughts, unexplained. “What was that?” said Remus Lupin at the same time. Harry turned, scanning the graveyard, but he didn’t see anything. Be- side him, Mr Lupin was doing the same. Neither of them noticed the tall stone worn as though from a thousand years of age, upon it a line within a circle within a triangle glowing ever so faintly silver, like the light which had shone from Harry’s wand, invisible at that distance beneath the still-bright Sun. Harry went back through Hogwarts, to the Ravenclaw Tower, feeling strange, and strengthened. He would not have expected any of that, but it had been all to the good. He was passing through the Ravenclaw common room, on the way to his dorm. That was when the shining creature came to him, gleaming soft white beneath the candle-fires of the Ravenclaw common room, as it slithered out from nowhere, the silver snake. 1599 The fifth meeting 10:12 a.m., Sunday, April 19th. The debtor’s meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from Harry Potter, who owed Lucius Malfoy a debt of some 58,203 Galleons, was held within the Gringotts Central Bank, in accordance with the laws of Britain. There had been some pushback from Chief Warlock Dumbledore, trying to prevent Harry Potter from leaving the security of Hogwarts (a phrase that caused Harry Potter to raise his fingers and silently make quote marks in the air). For his own part, the Boy-Who-Lived had seem- ingly pondered quietly, and then assented to the meeting, strangely compliant in the face of his enemy’s demand. The Headmaster of Hogwarts, who acted as Harry Potter’s legal guardian in the eyes of magical Britain, had overruled his ward’s assent. The Debts Committee of the Wizengamot had overruled the Headmas- ter of Hogwarts. The Chief Warlock had overruled the Debts Committee. The Wizengamot had overruled the Chief Warlock. And so the Boy-Who-Lived had departed under the heavy guard of Mad-Eye Moody and an Auror trio for the Gringotts Central Bank; with Moody’s bright-blue eye rotating wildly in every direction, as though to signal to any possible attacker that he was On Guard and Constantly Vig- ilant and would cheerfully incinerate the kidneys of anyone who sneezed in the general direction of the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry Potter watched more keenly than before, as they marched through the wide-open front doors of Gringotts, beneath the motto For- tius Quo Fidelius. On Harry’s last three visits to Gringotts he had merely admired the marble pillars, the gold-burning torches, the architecture not quite like the human parts of magical Britain. Since then had come the Incident at Azkaban and other things; and now, on his fourth visit, Harry was thinking about the Goblin Rebellions and goblins’ ongoing resentment at not being allowed to own wands and certain facts which hadn’t been in the first-year History textbook, which Harry had guessed at by pattern matching and which Professor Flitwick had confirmed in a very quiet voice. Lord Voldemort had killed goblins as well as wizards— an incredibly stupid move on Lord Voldemort’s part, unless Harry was really missing something—but what goblins thought of the Boy-Who- Lived, Harry had no idea. Goblins had a reputation for paying what they owed and taking what they thought owed them, along with a reputation for interpreting those accounts in a somewhat prejudiced fashion. Today, the guards standing upright in armour at regular intervals around the bank were staring at the Boy-Who-Lived with blank faces, and glaring at Moody and the Aurors with flashes of bitter contempt. At the stands and counters of the bank’s foyer, goblin tellers stared with equal contempt at the wizards whose hands they were filling with Galleons; one teller smiled a sharp-toothed grin at a witch who was looking angry and desperate. If I understand human nature correctly—and if I’m right that all the hu- manoid magical species are genetically human plus a heritable magical effect— then you’re not likely to become friends with a wizard just because I’m polite to you, or say that I’m sympathetic. But I wonder if you would back the Boy-Who-Lived in a bid to overthrow the Ministry, if I promised to revoke the Wand Law afterwards… or if I quietly gave you wands, and spell books, in exchange for your support…is that why the secret of wand-making is restricted to people like Ollivander? Though if you really are human, just plain human, then the goblin nation probably has its own internal horrors, its own Azkabans, for that is also human nature; in which case sooner or later I must overthrow or reform your own government as well. Hm. An aged goblin appeared before them, and Harry inclined his head with careful courtesy, a gesture that the aged goblin returned with an abrupt half-nod. There was no wild train ride; instead the aged goblin ushered them into a short hallway that terminated in a small waiting room, with three goblin-sized benches and one wizard-sized chair, within which nobody sat. “Do not sign anything that Lucius Malfoy gives you,” Mad-Eye Moody said. “Nothing, do you understand me, lad? If Malfoy hands you a copy of The Wonderful Adventures of the Boy-Who-Lived and asks you for an auto- graph, tell him that you’ve sprained a finger. Don’t pick up a quill for a sin- gle second while you’re in Gringotts. If someone hands you a quill, break the quill and then break your own fingers. Do I need to explain further, son?” “Not particularly,” Harry said. “We also have lawyers in Muggle Britain, and they’d think your lawyers are cute.” A short time later Harry Potter handed his wand over to an armoured goblin guard who frisked him with all manner of interesting-looking probes, and gave his pouch to Moody to keep. And then Harry stepped through another door, and a brief waterfall of Thief’s Downfall, which evaporated from his skin as soon as he stepped out. On the other side of the door was a larger room, richly panelled and appointed, with a great golden table stretching across it; two huge leather chairs on one side of the table, and a small wooden stool on the other, the debtor’s perch. Two goblins in full armour, wearing ornate earpieces and glasses, stood watch around the room. Neither side would have wands or any other device of magic, and the goblin guards would attack immediately if anyone dared to use wandless magic within this peaceable meeting supervised by Gringotts Bank. The ornate earpieces would prevent the goblin guards from hearing the conversation unless directly addressed, the eyepieces would leave the wizards’ faces as blurs. It was, in short, something along the lines of actual security, at least if you were an Occlumens. Harry climbed up onto his uncomfortable wooden stool, thinking Sub- tle in a tone of some mental sarcasm, and awaited his creditors. It was only a brief interval later, much shorter than the time a debtor could legally be made to wait, when Lucius Malfoy entered into the room, taking up his leather chair with motions worn smooth by practice. His snake-headed cane was missing from his hands, his long white mane drifted behind him the same as ever, his face could not be read. Quietly following behind him was a young boy with white-blonde hair, now wearing black robes far finer than any Hogwarts uniform, who followed in his father’s footsteps with a controlled face. A boy who was also Harry’s creditor to the tune of forty Galleons, and also of House Mal- foy, and therefore, technically, covered by the Wizengamot resolution enabling this meeting. Draco. Harry didn’t say it aloud, didn’t let his own expression change. He could not think of what to say. Not even I’m sorry seemed appropriate. Harry hadn’t dared say any of that to Draco’s Patronus either, when they had set up this meeting in a few brief exchanges; and not only because Lucius might be listening. It had been enough to know that Draco’s happy thought was still happy, and that he had still been able to want Harry to know it. Lucius Malfoy spoke first, his voice level, his face set. “I do not under- stand what is happening at Hogwarts, Harry Potter. Would you care to explain it to me?” “I don’t know,” Harry said. “If I understood these events I would not have let them happen, Lord Malfoy.” “Then answer me this question. Who are you?” Harry gazed evenly at the face of his creditor. “I’m not You-Know- Who, like you thought I was,” Harry said. Not being a complete idiot, he’d eventually worked out who Lucius Malfoy had thought he was talking to in front of the Wizengamot. “Obviously I’m not a normal boy. Equally obvi- ously, that probably has something to do with the Boy-Who-Lived business. But I don’t know what, or why, any more than you do. I asked the Sorting Hat and it didn’t know either.” Lucius Malfoy nodded distantly. “I could not think of any reason why you would pay a hundred thousand Galleons to save a mudblood’s life. No reason save one, which would account for her power and blood thirst alike; but then she died at the hands of a troll, and yet you lived. And also my son has told me much of you, Harry Potter, which did not make the tiniest bit of sense, I have heard the ravings of the mad in St. Mungo’s and they were more sensible by far than the events which my son told me under Veritaserum that you enacted, and that portion of this raving lunacy, which you personally carried out, I would have you explain to me, and now.” Harry turned to look at Draco, who looked back at him with a face that was screwing up, being controlled, and then tensing up again. “I’d also,” Draco Malfoy said in a high and wavering voice, “like, to know, why, Potter.” Harry closed his eyes, and spoke without looking. “A boy raised by Muggles who thought he was clever. You saw me, Draco, and you thought of how very useful it would be if the Boy-Who-Lived, out of all the other children in your year, could be shown the truth of things, if we could be friends. And I thought the same thing about you. Only, you and I believed different things were true. Not that I’m saying that there are different truths, I mean, there’s different beliefs but there’s only one reality, only one universe that can make those beliefs true or false—” “You lied to me.” Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco. “I would prefer to say,” Harry said, not quite with a steady voice, “that the things I told you were true from a certain point of view.” “A certain point of view?” Draco Malfoy looked every bit as angry as Luke Skywalker’d had the right to be, and not in a mood to accept Kenobi’s ex- cuses, either. “There’s a word for things that are true from a certain point of view. They’re called lies!” “Or tricks,” Harry said evenly. “Statements which are technically true but which deceive the listener into forming further beliefs which are false. I think it’s worth making that distinction. What I told you was a self- fulfilling prophecy; you believed that you couldn’t deceive yourself, so you didn’t try. The skills you’ve learned are real, and it would have been very bad for you to start fighting against them internally. People can’t make themselves believe that blue is green by an act of will, but they think they can, and that can be almost as bad.” “You used me,” said Draco Malfoy. “I only used you in ways that made you stronger. That’s what it means to be used by a friend.” “Even I know that’s not what friendship is!” Now Lucius Malfoy spoke again. “For what purpose? To what end?” Even the elder Malfoy’s voice was not quite steady. “Why?” Harry regarded him for a moment, and then turned to Draco. “Your father’s probably not going to believe this,” Harry said. “But you, Draco, should be able to see that everything which has happened is compatible with this hypothesis. And that any more cynical hypothesis wouldn’t ex- plain why I didn’t press you harder when you thought I had leverage, or why I taught you so much. I thought that the heir of House Malfoy, who’d been publicly seen to grab a Muggle-born girl to stop her falling off the roof of Hogwarts, would be a good compromise candidate to lead magical Britain after the reformation.” “So you would have me believe,” Lucius Malfoy said in a thin voice, “that you are claiming to be mad. Well, let us leave all that aside. Tell me who set that troll on Hogwarts.” “I don’t know,” Harry said. “Tell me who you suspect, Harry Potter.” “I have four suspects. One of them is Professor Snape—” “Snape?” Draco burst out. “The second, of course, is the Defence Professor of Hogwarts, just because he’s the Defence Professor.” Harry would have left him out, not wanting to bring Professor Quirrell to the Malfoys’ attention if he was innocent, but Draco might have challenged him on that. “The third, you wouldn’t believe me about. The fourth is a catch-all category called Ev- erything Else.” And the fifth, Lord Voldemort, I do not think I should name to you. Lucius Malfoy’s face contorted in a snarl. “Do you think I cannot rec- ognize bait upon your hook? Tell me about this third possibility, Potter, the one you wish me to believe is the true answer, and leave aside games.” Harry regarded Lord Malfoy steadily. “I once read a book I wasn’t sup- posed to read, and it told me this: communication is an event that takes place between equals. Employees lie to their bosses, who, in turn, expect to be lied to. I’m not playing coy, I’m observing that it’s simply not pos- sible, in our present situation, for me to tell you about the third suspect, and have you believe that my story was anything but a lure.” Draco spoke then. “It’s Father, isn’t it?” Harry gave Draco a startled look. Draco spoke evenly. “You suspect that Father sent the troll into Hog- warts to get at Granger, don’t you? That’s what you’re thinking, isn’t it!” Harry opened his mouth to say, Actually, no, and then managed to think ahead and stop himself for once in his life. “I see…” Harry said slowly. “That’s what this is about. Lucius Malfoy publicly says that Hermione won’t get away with what she’s done, and lo and behold, a troll kills her.” Harry smiled then, in a way that bared his teeth. “And if I deny that here, then Draco, who isn’t an Occlumens, can then testify under Veritaserum that the Boy-Who-Lived does not suspect Lucius Malfoy of having sent a troll into Hogwarts to kill Hermione Gran- ger, sworn to the Noble House of Potter, whose blood debt was recently purchased for a hundred thousand Galleons et cetera.” Harry leaned back slightly, though his wooden stool had no back with which to do it properly. “But now that it’s been pointed out, I see that it’s very reasonable. Obvi- ously you killed Hermione Granger, just like you threatened to do in front of the whole Wizengamot.” “I did not,” Lucius Malfoy said, expressionless once more. Harry bared his teeth again in that non-smile. “Well then, in that case, there must be someone else out there who killed Hermione and messed with the Hogwarts wards, the same person who earlier tried to frame Her- mione for Draco Malfoy’s murder. Either you killed Hermione Granger after being paid for her life, or you blamed your son’s attempted murder on an innocent girl and took all my family’s money under false pretences, one of those two things must be true.” “Perhaps you killed her in hopes of your money being returned.” Lucius Malfoy had leaned forward, and was staring hard at Harry. “Then I would not have given away my money for her in the first place. As you already know. Don’t insult my intelligence, Lord Malfoy—no, wait, sorry, you just had to say that in case Draco had to testify to it, never mind.” Lucius Malfoy sat back in his chair and stared. “I tried to tell you, Father,” Draco said under his breath, “but nobody can imagine Harry Potter until they’ve actually met him…” Harry tapped a finger on his cheek. “So people are starting to figure out the blatantly obvious? I’m surprised, actually. I wouldn’t have pre- dicted that would happen.” Harry had by now caught the general rhythm of Professor Quirrell’s cynicism and was able to generate it independently. “I wouldn’t think a newspaper would be able to report on a concept like ‘Ei- ther X or Y must be true, but we don’t know which.’ I would only expect journalists to report stories consisting of series of atomic propositions, like ‘X is true’, ‘Y is false’, or ‘X is true and Y is false’. Not more complex log- ical connectors like ‘If X is true then Y is true, but we don’t know whether X is true’. And all your supporters ought to be rapidly switching between ‘You can’t prove that Lord Malfoy killed Granger, it could’ve been some- one else’ and ‘You can’t prove there was someone else to frame Granger’, so long as it’s uncertain they should be trying to have it both ways at once… wait, don’t you own the Daily Prophet?” “The Daily Prophet,” Lucius Malfoy said thinly, “which I certainly do not own, is far too respectable to publish any such scurrilous nonsense. Unfortunately, not all wizards of influence are so reasonable.” “Ah. Got it.” Harry nodded. Lucius glanced at Draco. “The rest of what he said—was any of it im- portant?” “No, Father, it was not.” “Thank you, son.” Lucius returned his gaze to Harry. His voice, when he spoke, was something closer to his usual drawl, cool and confident. “It is possible that I could be persuaded to show you some favour, if you ad- mitted before the Wizengamot what you clearly know, that I was not re- sponsible for this deed. I would be willing to reduce your remaining debt to House Malfoy quite significantly, or even adjust the terms to allow later repayment.” Harry regarded Lucius Malfoy steadily. “Lucius Malfoy. You are now perfectly aware that Hermione Granger was, in fact, framed using your son as bait, that she was False-Memory-Charmed or worse, and that House Potter held nothing against you before that. My counterproposal is that you return my family’s money, I announce before the Wizengamot that House Potter holds House Malfoy no animus, and we present a united front against whoever’s doing this. We decide to screw the roles we’re supposed to play, and ally with each other instead of fighting. It could be the one thing the enemy doesn’t expect us to do.” There was a brief silence in the room, except for the two goblin guards who went on breathing regardless. “You are mad,” Lucius Malfoy said coldly. “It’s called justice, Lord Malfoy. You cannot possibly expect me to co- operate with you while you are holding the wealth of House Potter under what you now know to be false pretences. I understand how it looked to you at the time, but you know better now.” “You have nothing to offer me worth a hundred thousand Galleons.” “Don’t I?” Harry said distantly. “I wonder. I think it quite probable that you care more about the long-term welfare of House Malfoy than about whichever political issue the last generation’s failed Dark Lord made his personal hobbyhorse.” Harry glanced significantly at Draco. “The next generation is drawing its own battle lines and forming new alliances. Your son can be frozen out of that, or he can go straight to the top. Is that worth more to you than forty thousand Galleons you weren’t particularly expecting and don’t particularly need?” Harry smiled thinly. “Forty thousand Galleons. Two million Muggle pounds sterling. Your son knows some things about the size of the Muggle economy that might sur- prise you. They’d find it amusing, that the fate of a country was revolving around two million pounds sterling. They’d think it was cute. And I think much the same, Lord Malfoy. This isn’t about me being desperate. This is about you getting a fair chance to be fair.” “Oh?” said Lord Malfoy. “And if I refuse your fair chance, what then?” Harry shrugged. “Depends what sort of coalition government gets put together without the Malfoys. If the government can be reformed peace- fully and it would disturb the peace to do otherwise, I’ll pay you the money out of petty cash. Or maybe the Death Eaters will be retried for past crimes and executed as a matter of justice, as a result of due legal process, of course.” “You truly are mad,” Lucius Malfoy said quietly. “You have no power, no wealth, and yet you say such things to me.” “Yes, it’s silly to think I could scare you. After all, you’re not a Demen- tor.” And Harry went on smiling. He’d looked it up, and apparently a be- zoar would heal almost any poison if you shoved it into someone’s mouth fast enough. Maybe that wouldn’t repair radiation damage from Transfig- ured polonium, but then again, maybe it would. So Harry had looked up the freezing points of various acids, and it turned out that sulphuric acid would freeze at just ten degrees Celsius, which meant Harry could buy a litre of acid on the Muggle market, freeze it solid, and Transfigure it down to a tiny little unnoticeable water-ice chip to be flipped into some- one’s mouth and ingested. No bezoar would compensate for that, once the Transfiguration wore off. Harry had no intention of saying it out loud, of course, but now that he’d failed decisively to prevent any deaths during his quest, he had no further intention of being restrained by the law or even the code of Batman. Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life was bought and paid for the day you committed your first atrocity for the Death Eaters. You’re still hu- man and your life still has intrinsic value, but you no longer have the deontological protection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed to kill you now, if they think it’ll save net lives in the long run; and I will conclude as much of you, if you begin to get in my way. Whoever sent the troll after Granger must have targeted you too and hit you with some curse that makes former Death Eaters melt into a pile of goo. Very sad. “Father,” Draco said in a small voice. “I think you should consider it, father.” Lucius Malfoy looked at his son. “You jest.” “It’s true. I don’t think Potter just made up his books, nobody could have written all that and there were things in them that I could check for myself. And if even half of all that is true, he’s right, a hundred thousand Galleons won’t mean much. If we give it to him he really will be friends with House Malfoy again—the way he thinks of being friends, anyway. And if we don’t, he’ll be your enemy, whether it’s in his own interests or not, he’ll just go after you. Harry Potter really does think like that. It’s not about money to him, it’s about what he thinks is honour.” Harry Potter inclined his head, still smiling. “But let’s get one part of it straight,” Draco said, now staring directly at him. There was a fierce light in his eyes. “You wronged me. And you owe me.” “Acknowledged,” Harry said quietly. “Conditional on the rest of it, of course.” Lucius Malfoy opened his mouth to say who-knew-what and then closed it again. “Mad,” he said again. There was a long father-and-son argument during which Harry man- aged to keep his mouth shut. When it seemed that even Draco wouldn’t be able to persuade his fa- ther, Harry spoke up again, and proposed his intended next steps, if the Houses of Potter and Malfoy could cooperate. Then came more argument between Lucius and Draco, during which Harry again stayed silent. Finally Lucius Malfoy’s eyes turned to gaze at Harry. “And you believe,” Lucius Malfoy said, “that you can persuade Longbottom and Bones to go along with this notion, even if Dumbledore opposes it.” Harry nodded. “They’ll be suspicious of your involvement, of course. But I’ll tell them that it was my plan to start with, and that should help.” “I suppose,” Lucius Malfoy said after a pause, “that I could have a con- tract drawn up, absolving you of almost all the remaining debt, if by some chance I do go along with this mad idea. It shall need more guarantees, of course—” Harry promptly reached into his robes and drew out a parchment, unfolding it and spreading it across the golden table. “I’ve taken the liberty myself, actually,” Harry said. He’d spent some careful hours in the Hogwarts library with the law books available. Thankfully, so far as Harry could tell, the laws of magical Britain were charmingly simple by Muggle standards. Writing that the original blood debt and payment was cancelled, the Potters’ wealth and all other vault items would be returned, and the remaining debt annulled, all with no fault to the Malfoys, was only a few more lines than it took to say out loud. “I had to promise my keepers not to sign anything you gave me. So I made sure to compose this myself, and sign it before I left.” Draco emitted a choked laugh. Lucius read through the contract, smiling humourlessly. “How charm- ingly straightforward.” “I also promised not to touch a quill while I was in Gringotts,” Harry said. He reached into his robes again and drew out a Muggle pen, along with a sheet of normal paper. “Will this wording be all right?” Harry rapidly scribbled down a legal-sounding statement to the effect that House Potter didn’t hold House Malfoy responsible in any way for Hermi- one Granger’s murder and didn’t believe they had anything to do with it, then held up the paper in the air for Lord Malfoy’s inspection. Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and said, “Good enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning, you should use the legal term indemnify rather than exonerate—” “Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord Malfoy.” Harry took his parchment and began copying down his original wording more carefully. When Harry was done, Lord Malfoy reached across the golden table and took the pen, looking at it thoughtfully. “One of your Muggle artefacts, I suppose? What does this do, son?” “It writes without needing an inkwell,” Draco answered. “I can see that. I suppose some might find it an amusing trinket.” Lu- cius smoothed the parchment contract over the table, then set his hand by the line for signatures, tapping the pen thoughtfully on the starting spot. Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy’s face, forcing him- self to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his muscles from tensing. “Our good friend, Severus Snape,” said Lucius Malfoy, still tapping the pen on the line awaiting his signature. “The Defence Professor, call- ing himself Quirrell. Now I ask again, who is your third suspect, Harry Potter?” “I would strongly advise that you sign first, Lord Malfoy, if you’re going to do so anyway. You will benefit from this information more if you do not think I am trying to persuade you of something.” Another humourless smile. “I shall take my chances. Speak, if you wish this to continue.” Harry hesitated, then said evenly, “My third suspect is Albus Dumble- dore.” The tapping pen stilled on the parchment. “A strange allegation,” Lu- cius drawled. “Dumbledore lost much face when a Hogwarts student died within his tenure. Do you suppose that I will believe anything of him, only because he is my enemy?” “He is one suspect among several, Lord Malfoy, and not necessarily the most plausible. But the reason I was able to kill a full-grown mountain troll was that I had a weapon which Dumbledore gave to me, at the start of the school year. It’s not strong evidence, but it’s suspicious. And if you’re thinking that murdering one of his students is not Dumbledore’s style, well, the same thought had occurred to me.” “It’s not his style?” Draco Malfoy said. Lucius Malfoy shook his head in a measured, careful movement. “Not quite, my son. Dumbledore is particular in his evils.” Lord Malfoy leaned back into his chair, and then sat quite still. “Tell me of this weapon.” “I am not yet certain I should go into details about that in your pres- ence, Lord Malfoy.” Harry took a breath. “Let me be clear on this. I am not trying to sell you on the idea that Dumbledore is behind this, just raising the possibility—” Then Draco Malfoy spoke. “The device Dumbledore gave you—was it something to kill trolls? I mean, just trolls? Can you tell us that?” Lucius turned his head to look at his son with some surprise. “No…” Harry said slowly. “It wasn’t specifically a sword of troll slaying, or anything like that.” Draco’s eyes were intent. “Would the device have worked against an assassin?” Not if they had shields raised. “No.” “A fight in school?” An expanding rock in the throat is inherently lethal. “No. I don’t think it was meant for use against humans.” Draco nodded. “So just magical creatures. Would it have been a good weapon against an angry Hippogriff, or something like that?” “Does the Stunning Hex work on Hippogriffs?” Harry said slowly. “I don’t know,” said Draco. “Yes,” said Lucius Malfoy. Compared to trying to target a Wingardium Leviosa and Finite Incantatem— “Then a Stunning Hex would be a better way of dealing with a Hippogriff.” Put that way, it did seem increasingly like a Transfigured rock was an op- timal weapon only against a flesh-and-blood magical creature with spell- resistant skin. “But…I mean, it might not have been intended as a weapon at all, I used it in a strange way, it could have just been a crazy whim—” “No,” Lucius Malfoy said quietly. “Not a whim. Not coincidence. Not Dumbledore.” “Then it’s him,” Draco said. Slowly Draco’s eyes narrowed, and he gave a vicious nod. “It’s been him since the beginning. The court Legilimens said that someone had used Legilimency on Granger. Dumbledore admitted that it was him. And I bet the wards did go off when Granger cursed me and Dumbledore just ignored them.” “But—” Harry said. He looked at Lucius, wondering if it was really to his advantage to question this idea. “What would be his motive? Are we going to say he’s evil and leave it at that?” Draco Malfoy jumped out of his chair and began pacing around the room, black robes swishing behind the young boy, the goblin guards star- ing at him in some surprise through their enchanted goggles. “To figure out a strange plot, look at what happens, then ask who benefits. Except that Dumbledore didn’t plan on you trying to save Granger at her trial, he tried to stop you from doing that. What would’ve happened if Granger had gone to Azkaban? House Malfoy and House Potter would’ve hated each other forever. Of all the suspects, the only one who wants that is Dumble- dore. So it fits. It all fits. The one who really committed the murder is— Albus Dumbledore!” “Um,” Harry said. “But why give me an anti-troll weapon? I said it was suspicious, I didn’t say that it made any sense.” Draco nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe Dumbledore thought you’d stop the troll before it got Granger and then he could blame Father for send- ing it. A lot of people would be very angry if they thought Father had even tried to do something like that, in Hogwarts. Like Father said, Dumble- dore must’ve lost face when people found out that a student had actually died in Hogwarts, being safe is what Hogwarts is famous for. So that part probably wasn’t supposed to happen.” Harry’s mind involuntarily flashed back to the horror in Dumbledore’s eyes when he’d seen Hermione Granger’s body. Would I have got there in time, if the Weasley twins hadn’t had their magic map stolen? Could that have been the plan? And then, though Dumbledore didn’t know it, somebody stole their map, and I was too late…but no, that doesn’t make much sense, I found out too late, how could Dumbledore have guessed that I’d use a broomstick…well, he did know I had one… There was no way a plan like that could work. And it hadn’t. But someone going a little bit senile might expect it to work, and a phœnix might not know the difference. “Or,” Draco Malfoy continued, still pacing energetically, “maybe Dum- bledore had an enchanted troll around, and he expected you to defeat it some other time, for some other plot, and then he used the troll on Gran- ger instead. I can’t imagine Dumbledore had this all planned since the first week of lessons—” “I can imagine,” Lucius Malfoy said in low tones. “I have seen such, from Dumbledore.” Draco nodded decisively. “Then I was never supposed to die in the first plot. Dumbledore knew Professor Quirrell was checking on me, or Dum- bledore planned to have someone else find me in time—I couldn’t have testified against Granger if I was dead, and he’d have lost face if I’d died. But my leaving Hogwarts and not being around to lead Slytherin would be just right for him. And then the next time Harry was supposed to stop the troll before it got Granger and everyone was supposed to blame you, Father, only that time it didn’t go the way Dumbledore planned.” Lucius Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, from where he’d been gazing with open surprise at his son. “If this is true—but I wonder if Harry Potter is only playing at being reluctant to believe it.” “Maybe,” Draco said. “But I’m pretty sure he isn’t.” “Then, if it is true…” Lucius Malfoy’s voice trailed off. A slow fury was lighting in his eyes. “What would we do, exactly?” Harry said. “That, too, is clear to me,” Draco said. He whirled on them and raised a finger high in the air. “We shall find the proof to convict Dumbledore of this crime, and bring him to justice!” Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy looked at each other. Neither of them quite knew what to say. “My son,” Lucius Malfoy said after a time, “truly, you have done very well this day.” “Thank you, Father!” “However, this is not a play, we are not Aurors, and we do not put our trust in trials.” Some of the light went out of Draco’s eyes. “Oh.” “I, ah, do have a sentimental fondness for trials,” Harry interjected. I cannot believe I am having this conversation. He needed to go home and take a sheet of paper and a pencil and try to figure out whether Draco’s reason- ing actually made sense. “And evidence.” Lucius Malfoy turned his gaze to Harry Potter then, and his eyes sim- mered in pure grey fury. “If you have deceived me,” Lucius Malfoy said in tones of low anger, “if all this is a lie, then I will not forgive. But if this is not deception…. Bring me the proof to convict Dumbledore of this murder before the Wizen- gamot, or evidence enough to have him cast down, and there is nothing that House Malfoy will not do for you, Harry Potter. Nothing.” Harry took a deep breath. He needed to sort all this out and figure out the actual probabilities, but he didn’t have time. “If it is Dumbledore, then removing him from the game board leaves a huge hole in Britain’s power structure.” “So it does,” Lucius Malfoy said with a grim smile. “Did you have am- bitions of filling it yourself, Harry Potter?” “Some of your opposition might not like that. They could fight.” “They will lose,” Lucius Malfoy said, now with a face hard like iron. “So this is what I’d want House Malfoy to do for me, Lord Malfoy, if Dumbledore gets removed because of me. When the opposition is most frightened—that’s when they’ll be offered a last-minute arrangement to avoid a civil war. Some of your allies might not prefer it, but there’ll be a lot of neutrals who’ll be glad to see stability. The bargain will be that instead of you taking over right away, Draco Malfoy will take power when he comes of age.” “What?” Draco said. “Draco has testified under Veritaserum that he tried to help Hermi- one Granger. I bet there’d be a lot of people in the opposition who’d take a chance on him rather than fight. I’m not sure how exactly you’d enforce it—Unbreakable Vows or Gringotts contracts or what—but there’ll be some sort of enforceable compact about power going to Draco after he graduates Hogwarts. I’ll throw any support the Boy-Who-Lived has be- hind that bargain. Try to persuade Longbottom and Bones and so on. Our first plan paves the way for that later, if you’re careful to act honourable when you deal with Longbottom and Bones this time around.” “Father, I swear I didn’t—” Lucius’s face twisted into a grim smile. “I know you didn’t, son. Well.” The white-haired man stared across the mighty golden table at Harry Pot- ter. “Those terms are acceptable to me. But fail in any part of our agree- ment, whether our first bargain, or the second, and there shall be conse- quences for you, Harry Potter. Clever words will not halt that.” And Lucius Malfoy signed the parchment. 1617 CH APTER 97 1618 1619 CH APTER 98 162 0 ROLES, FINAL Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they had glimpsed his hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list, written on strange not-parchment. Harry had explained that, all things considered, he didn’t really think it was smart for him to be findable ex- cept on special occasions, so he was just going to deal with people as a disembodied floating voice from now on, or as a brilliant silver light that hid behind corners where nobody could see it, and which could always find his friends no matter where they tried to hide. It was, in all honesty, one of the creepiest things which Fred and George had ever heard, over a lifetime which had included filling the shoes of every student in second- year Slytherin with Transfigured live millipedes. Fred and George didn’t think this could possibly be good for anyone’s sanity, but they didn’t know what to say. It couldn’t be denied, they’d seen with their own four eyes, that Hogwarts… …wasn’t safe… “I don’t know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on Rita Skeeter,” said the sourceless voice of Harry Potter. “Whoever it is… probably won’t be able to fill this order directly, but they may know some- one who can get things from the Muggle world. And—I know it may cost extra, but as few people as possible should know that Harry Potter is related to this.” Another flash of a small boy’s hand, and a bag hit the ground with the clinking noise. “Some of these items are expensive even in the Muggle world, and your contact may have to go outside Britain; but one hundred Galleons will be enough to pay for it all, I hope. I’d tell you where the Galleons came from, but I don’t want to spoil tomorrow’s surprise.” “What is this stuff?” said Fred or George, as they looked over the list. “Our father is a Muggle expert—” “—and we don’t recognize half this stuff—” “—why, we don’t recognize any of it—” “—just what are you planning to do?” “Things have become serious,” Harry’s voice said softly. “I don’t know what I’ll have to do. I may need the power of the Muggles, not just the wizards, before this is done—and I might need it right away, with no time to prepare. I’m not planning to use any of this. I just want it around in case of…contingencies.” Harry’s voice paused. “Obviously I owe you more than I can ever repay and you won’t let me give you any of what you deserve, I don’t even know how to say thank you properly, and all I can do is hope that some day when you grow up you’ll be more sensible about this whole thing and would you please take a ten percent commission—” “Shut up, you,” said George or Fred. “For God’s sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his ribs broken!” They both just shook their heads. Harry had stayed behind when they’d told him to run, and stepped forward to distract the troll from eat- ing George. Harry was the kind of person, they knew, who’d think that something like that didn’t cancel out what he owed the Weasley twins, that his own deed wasn’t properly commensurate. But what the Weasleys knew, and Harry wouldn’t understand until he was older, was that it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be owed between them. It was a strange kind of selfishness, they thought, that Harry could un- derstand kindness within himself—never dreaming of asking of money from anyone he’d helped more than they’d helped him, or calling that a debt—while being apparently unable to conceive that others might want to act the same way toward him. “Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel Atlas Shrugged,” the sourceless voice said. “I’m starting to understand what sort of person can benefit from reading it.” 1623 CH APTER 98 1624 ROLES, FINAL “First!” Daphne said. Daphne was trying to keep her trembling under control, as she faced the Four Houses at the forefront of the five. There was only so far her parents’ lessons in speech-making could take her. Daphne’s eyes darted down quickly to her hand, upon which, written with a quill in faint red ink, cues to her lines had been written. “Students are not to go anywhere alone, not even to the toilets! You will travel in groups of at least three, and every group must have a sixth-year or seventh-year student!” “Second!” Susan Bones said from behind her, voice almost firm. “To further ensure the students’ safety, nine Aurors have been dispatched to Hogwarts to form an Auxiliary Protective Force!” Susan took a small, round glass object from within her robes, one of the communicators that the DMLE used, which they’d all been given. Susan raised it to her mouth and said, her voice now higher, “Auror Brodski, this is Susan Bones. Enter!” The doors to the Hall slammed open, and in marched nine Aurors in the reinforced leather gear they used when on duty. At once they spread out, two Aurors taking up station by each of the four tables, and the last took up watch at the Head Table. There were more gasps. “Third!” said Draco Malfoy, his voice commanding. Malfoy had appar- ently memorized his own lines, since there was nothing written on his hand that Daphne could see. “In the face of a common enemy who does not balk at killing students from any House, the four Houses of Hogwarts must come together and act as one! To emphasize this, the House Points system is temporarily suspended! All Professors will encourage solidarity between Houses, by decree of the Hogwarts Board of Governors!” “Fourth!” recited Neville Longbottom. “All students not already in the Defence Professor’s after-school classes, will receive special training in self-defence by Auror instructors!” “Fifth!” Theodore Nott yelled in a menacing tone. “All fighting in the corridors or anywhere outside of Defence lessons will be dealt with severely! Fight together or don’t fight at all!” “Sixth!” said Daphne Greengrass, and took a deep breath. When she’d found out what was planned, she’d made her own little extra request to Mother through the Floo. Even with Lucius Malfoy going along with Amelia Bones—a thought her mind was still having trouble grasping— the Greengrass swing vote had still been vital, since Jugson and his own faction had refused to back Malfoy. Not to mention that Bones didn’t trust Malfoy, and Malfoy didn’t trust Bones. So Mother had demanded, and the Greengrasses had received—“Since Memory Charms have been used on students without setting off wards, it is possible that someone on the Hogwarts faculty may be implicated. Therefore! The Auxiliary Protective force reports directly to my father, Lord Greengrass!” And this part was only symbolic, she knew, there’d be no reason anyone wouldn’t just contact the Aurors directly; but it might turn into more, some day, which was why she’d asked Mother to demand it—“And if anyone wants to report something to the Auxiliary Protectors, they can talk to the Au- rors, or go through me—” Daphne’s arm swept behind her to indicate the gathered students. “The duly appointed President of the Auxiliary Protective Special Committee!” And Daphne paused dramatically. They’d all rehearsed this part. “We don’t know who the enemy is,” said Neville, whose voice did not squeak. “We don’t know what the enemy wants,” said Theodore, still looking menacing. “But we know who the enemy is attacking,” said Susan, as fierce as when she’d taken on three seventh-year students. “The enemy is attacking Hogwarts students,” said Draco Malfoy, clear and commanding, like all this was his natural element. “And Hogwarts,” spoke Daphne of Greengrass, feeling her blood burn like it never had before in her life, “is going to fight back.” CHAPTER NINET Y-NINE ROLES, AFTERMATH Ten days later, the first dead unicorn was found in the Forbidden For- est. Part VI Harry James Potter- Evans-Verres and the Philosopher’s Stone CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES, PART I May 13th, 1992 Argus Filch’s face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp he held, shadows dancing over his face. Behind them the doors of Hogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The track they now walked was muddy and indistinct. The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet fully clad with spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky like lean fingers, skeletons visible amid the thin foliage. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it often threw them into darkness, lit only by the dim flames of Filch’s lamp. Draco kept a firm grip on his wand. “Where are you taking us?” said Tracey Davis. She’d been caught along with Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted meeting of the Silvery Slytherins after curfew hours, and likewise given a detention. “You just follow me,” said Argus Filch. Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair. The Silvery Slytherins ought to be recognized school business. There was no reason why a secret conspiracy shouldn’t have permission to meet after curfew, if it was for the greater good of Hogwarts. If this happened one more time he’d talk to Daphne Greengrass and Daphne would talk to her father and then Filch would learn the wisdom of looking the other way where Malfoys were concerned. The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distance when Filch spoke again. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” Filch turned his head, away from the lamp, so that he could leer at the four students following him. “Oh yes…hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me…It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out…hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever needed…” “Hey!” Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice. “I’m too young to hear about that—that sort of—you know! Especially if the chains are well oiled!” Draco wasn’t paying attention. Filch simply wasn’t in Amycus Car- row’s league. Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them snick- ered, though she didn’t say anything. Beside her was the other, a tall boy with a Slavic cast to his face, and who still spoke with an accent. They’d been caught for some unrelated offense, having to do with the type of thing Tracey went on about, and looked to be in their third or fourth year. “Pfeh,” said the taller boy. “In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down by your toes. By one toe, if you are insolent. Hogwarts was soft even in the old days.” Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though trying to think of a proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle. “We’ll see what you say about that…when you learn what you’ll be doing tonight! Ha!” “I said, I’m too young for that sort of thing!” said Tracey Davis. “It has to wait until I’m older!” Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the pro- portions seemed wrong. Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking. From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem too short around it. The figure was followed by a dog that seemed like a puppy by comparison, until you looked at it apart from the taller silhouette and realized the dog was huge, more like a wolf. Draco’s eyes narrowed, before he caught himself. As a Silvery Slythe- rin he wasn’t supposed to be Prejudiced against any sentient being, espe- cially not where other people might see him. “What’s this?” said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the half-giant. His umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than Filch’s dim lamp. In his other hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of short bolts was strapped to his upper arm. “Students serving detention,” Filch said, loudly. “They’re to help you search the Forest for…whatever’s been eating ’em.” “The Forest?” gasped Tracey. “We can’t go in there at night!” “That’s right,” said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at them. “It’s into the Forest you’re going, and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” “But—” said Tracey. “There’s werewolves, I’ve heard, and vampires, and everyone knows what happens when there’s a girl and a werewolf and a vampire all at the same time!” The huge half-giant was frowning. “Argus, I ’ad in mind you an’ maybe a few seventh-years. ’Ere’s not much point in bringing along help if I’m to watch over ’em the whole time.” Argus’s face lit with cruel satisfaction. “That’s their lookout, isn’t it? Should’ve thought of them werewolves before they got in trouble, shouldn’t they? Send them out alone. I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid. They’re here to be punished, after all.” The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man hav- ing all the air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex). “Yeh’ve done yer bit. I’ll take over from here.” “I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added nas- tily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. “Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight an’ I don’ want no-one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a moment.” He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze blew over Draco’s head as he looked into the Forest. “There’s summat in there that’s bin eatin’ unicorns,” the huge man said. Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something along those lines a couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April. “Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a wounded unicorn?” Tracey said excitedly. “No,” said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer. “Filch gave us the detention note at lunch today, at noon. Mr Hagrid wouldn’t wait that long to find a wounded unicorn, and if we were looking for some- thing like that, we’d look in the day when it’s bright. So,” Draco held up a finger, like he’d seen Inspector León do in plays, “I infer that we’re looking for something that only comes out at night.” “Aye,” said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful. “Yer not what I ex- pected, Draco Malfoy. Not what I expected at all. An’ you’d be Tracey Davis, then. I’ve heard of yeh. One of poor Miss Granger’s lot.” Rubeus Hagrid looked over at the two older Slytherins, peering at them in the light of his glowing umbrella. “An’ who’d yeh be, again? Don’t remember seeing much of yeh, boy.” “Cornelia Walt,” said the witch, “and this is Yuri Yuliy,” indicating the Slavic-looking boy who’d spoken of Durmstrang. “His family is visiting from the Ukrainian lands, so he’s in Hogwarts just for the year.” The older boy nodded, a faintly contemptuous cast on his face. “This is Fang,” Hagrid said, indicating the dog. The five of them set off into the woods. “What could be killing unicorns?” Draco said after they’d walked for a few minutes. Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he couldn’t remember anything that was said to prey on unicorns. “What sort of crea- ture does that, does anyone know?” “Werewolves!” said Tracey. “Miss Davis?” Draco said, and when she looked at him, he silently pointed a finger up at the moon. It was waxing gibbous, but not yet full. “Oh, right,” said Tracey. “No weres in the Forest,” said Hagrid. “They’re plain wizards most o’ the time, ’member. Couldn’t be wolves either, they’re not near fast enough ter catch a unicorn. Powerful magical creatures, unicorns are, I never knew one ter be hurt before.” Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite him- self. “Then what is fast enough to catch a unicorn?” “Wouldn’t ’ave been a matter of speed,” Hagrid said, giving Draco an indecipherable glance. “’Ere’s no end ter the ways that creatures hunt. Poi- son, darkness, traps. Imps as can’t be seen or heard or remembered, even while they’re eatin’ yer face. Always summat new an’ wonderful to learn.” A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit only by the glow of Hagrid’s umbrella. “Meself,” Hagrid continued, “I think we might ’ave a Parisian hydra on our ’ands. They’re no threat to a wizard, yeh’ve just got to keep holdin’ ’em off long enough, and there’s no way yeh can lose. I mean literally no way yeh can lose so long’s yeh keep fightin’. Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most creatures give up long before. Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh see.” “Bah,” said the foreign boy. “In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buch- holz hydra. Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannot imagine. First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible! Instructor must give second order, iterate until they comprehend.” They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the Forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees, gleaming a brighter colour beneath the moonlight. “Is that—” “Unicorn’s blood,” Hagrid said. The huge man’s voice was sad. In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a great oak, they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad upon the ground, the dirt around her shining moon-silver with pooled blood. The unicorn was not white, but pale blue, or appearing so beneath the moon and night sky. Her slender legs stuck out at odd angles, obviously bro- ken, and her mane spread across the dark leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls. On her flank was a small white shape like a starburst, a centre surrounded by eight straight rays. Half her side had been ripped away, the edges ragged like the marks of teeth, bones and inner organs exposed. A strange choking sensation rose in Draco’s throat. “That’s ’er,” Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal man’s voice. “Just where I found ’er this mornin’, dead as a dead doorknob. She is—was—the first unicorn I e’er met in these woods. I called ’er Alicorn, not that it matters ter ’er any more, I s’pose.” “You named a unicorn Alicorn,” said the older girl. Her voice was a bit dry. “But she doesn’t have wings,” Tracey said. “An alicorn’s a unicorn’s horn,” Hagrid said, now louder. “Don’t know where yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings, ’ere’s no such thing I ever heard. It’s just like naming a dog Fang,” indicating the huge wolf-like dog that barely came to his knees. “What’d you have called ’er? Hannah, or some such? I gave ’er a name as would’ve meant summat ter ’er. Common courtesy, I call it.” Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the huge man gave a sharp nod. “We’ll start our search from ’ere, the last place it struck. We’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy—yeh’ll go that way, and take Fang. There’s nothin’ that lives in the Forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with Fang. Send up green sparks if yeh find summat interestin’, an’ send up red sparks if anyone gets in trouble. Davis, Malfoy, with me.” The Forest was black and silent. Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the light of his umbrella after they’d set out, so that Draco and Tracey had to steer themselves by the light of the moon, not without occasional trips and falls. They walked past a mossy tree stump, the sound of running water speak- ing of a stream somewhere close by. Now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves; they were following the trail of blood, toward where the creature must have first struck the unicorn. “There’s rumours about yeh,” Hagrid said in a low voice after they’d walked for a while. “Well, they’re all true,” Tracey said. “All of them.” “Not yeh,” Hagrid said. “Did yeh really testify under Veritaserum that yeh tried to help Miss Granger, three times it was?” Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, “Yes.” It wouldn’t have done to appear too eager to claim credit. The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping silently through the woods. “I’m surprised, teh be honest. And yeh too, Davis, tryin’ to put the halls in order. Are yeh sure the Sorting Hat put yeh in the right place? There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin, so it’s always been said.” “That’s not true,” Tracey said. “What about Xiaonan Tong the Black Raven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister Kayvon?” “Who?” said Hagrid. “Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two centuries,” Tracey said. “They’re probably the best from Hogwarts who weren’t from Slytherin.” Her voice fell, lost its enthusiasm. “Miss Granger always told me I should read up on anything I—” “Anyway,” Draco said quickly, “that’s not really relevant, Mr Hagrid. Even if—” Draco worked it around in his head, trying to translate the dif- ference between probability of Slytherin given Dark and probability of Dark given Slytherin into non-scientific language. “Even if most Dark Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards. There aren’t all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one.” Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly know much of the secret lore, the more…costly rituals were better left to useful fools like Amycus Carrow. “So yeh’re saying,” Hagrid said, “that most Dark Wizards are Slythe- rins…but…” “But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,” Draco said. He had a weary feeling they’d be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra, the im- portant thing was to not give up. “I never thought of it that way,” the huge man said, sounding awestruck. “But, well, if yeh’re not all a house of snakes, then why—get behind that tree!” Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out a bolt and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Ha- grid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. “I knew it,” Hagrid murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.” They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with Hagrid in the lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands at the ready, but they found nothing, despite searching in a widening circle with their ears straining for the faintest sound. They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Draco kept looking over his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they were being watched. They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled and pointed. In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air. “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay where yeh are, I’ll come back for yeh!” Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away through the undergrowth. Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard nothing but the rustling of leaves around them. Tracey looked scared, but trying to hide it. Draco was feeling more annoyed than anything else. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed his plans for tonight, had not spent even five seconds visualizing the consequences if something actually went wrong. “Now what?” said Tracey, her voice a little high. “We wait for Mr Hagrid to come back.” The minutes dragged by. Draco’s ears seemed sharper than usual, picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. Tracey kept looking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that it wasn’t full yet. “I’m—” Tracey whispered. “I’m getting a little nervous, Mr Malfoy.” Draco thought about it a bit. To be honest, there was something…well, it wasn’t that he was a coward, or even that he was scared. But there had been a murder at Hogwarts and if he’d been watching himself in a play, having just been abandoned in the Forbidden Forest by a half-giant, he would currently feel like yelling at the boy on stage that he should… Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror. Tapping the sur- face showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost immediately. “Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,” the man said clearly, causing Tracey to start with the loudness in the quiet forest. “What is it, Draco Malfoy?” “Put me on ten-minute check-in,” Draco said. He’d decided not to complain directly about his detention. He did not want to look like a spoiled brat. “If I don’t respond, come get me. I’m in the Forbidden Forest.” Inside the mirror, the Auror’s brows rose. “What are you doing in the Forbidden Forest, Mr Malfoy?” “Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr Hagrid,” Draco said, and tapped the mirror off, putting it back in his robes before the Auror could ask anything about detentions or say anything about serving it out without complaining. Tracey’s head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim to read her expression. “Um, thanks,” she whispered. The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as an- other, colder breeze blew through the forest. Tracey’s voice was a little louder when she spoke again. “You didn’t have to—” she said, now sounding a little shy. “Don’t mention it, Miss Davis.” The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as though to conceal a blush that wasn’t visible anyway. “I mean, not for me—” “No, really,” Draco said. “Don’t mention it. At all.” He would have threatened to take out the mirror and order Captain Brodski not to rescue her, but he was afraid she would consider that flirting. Tracey’s silhouetted head turned from him, looked away. Finally she said, in a smaller voice, “It’s too soon, isn’t it—” A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound, the scream of something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and ran. “No, you numbskull!” yelled Draco, plunging after her. The sound had been so eerie that Draco wasn’t certain where it came from—but he thought that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running straight toward the source of that eerie scream. Brambles whipped at Draco’s eyes, he had to keep one hand in front of his face to shield them, trying not to lose track of Tracey because it seemed obvious that, if this was a play, and they got separated, one of them was going to die. Draco thought of the mirror secured within his robes but he somehow knew that if he tried to take it out one-handed while running, the mirror would inevitably fall and be lost— Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for an in- stant, before he saw. Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly widen- ing pool of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping across the ground like spilled mercury. Her coat was purple, like the colour of the night sky, her horn exactly the same twilight colour as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink star-blotch surrounded by white patches. The sight tore at Draco’s heart, even more than the other unicorn because this one’s eyes were staring glassily right at him, and because there was a— —blurring, twisting form— —feeding on an open wound on the unicorn’s side, like it was drinking from it— —Draco couldn’t understand, somehow couldn’t recognize what he was seeing— —it was looking at them. The blurring, seething, unrecognisable darkness seemed to turn to re- gard them. A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest snake which ever had existed, something more dangerous by far than any Blue Krait. Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued to drink. The mirror was in Draco’s hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over. Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like “Prismatis” and “Stupefy” but nothing was happening. Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet only not so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a strange half-jump across the dying unicorn’s legs, approaching the two of them. Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from some- thing that could hunt down unicorns. Before she could take three steps there came another terrible hiss, burning his ears, and Tracey fell to the ground and did not move. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about to die. Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant, there was no way anyone could get here fast enough. There was no time. Running hadn’t worked. Magic hadn’t worked. The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last mo- ments, to solve the riddle. Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky and hung there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and the seething out- line leapt backwards, as though in horror of the light. Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with bright multicoloured shields and Harry Potter holding his wand aloft, seated behind Professor McGonagall within a larger shield. “Get out of here!” roared Professor McGonagall— —an instant before the seething thing gave forth another terrible hiss, and all the shielding spells winked out. The three Aurors and Professor McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and dropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless. Draco couldn’t breathe, the most intense fear he’d ever felt in his life gripping all through his chest, sending tendrils around his heart. Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided his broomstick to- ward the ground— —and then leapt off to stand between Draco and the seething outline, interpos- ing himself like a living shield. “Run!” said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look at Draco. The sil- ver moonlight gleamed on his face. “Run, Draco! I’ll hold it off!” “You can’t fight that thing alone!” Draco cried aloud. A nausea was in his stom- ach, a churning sensation that, looking back in memory, seemed both like and un- like a sense of guilt, as though it had the sensations but not quite all of the emotion. “I must,” Harry Potter said grimly. “Go!” “Harry, I—I’m sorry, for everything—I” Though later, looking back, Draco couldn’t quite remember what he’d meant to apologize for, maybe it’d been that he was planning to overthrow Harry’s conspiracy, all that time ago. The seething figure, now seeming blacker and more terrible, rose up into the air, hovering off the ground. “Go!” shouted Harry. Draco turned and fled headlong into the woods,with the branches whipping at his face. Behind him, Draco heard another terrible hiss, and Harry’s voice rising, crying something that Draco couldn’t make out from the distance; Draco turned his head for only an instant to look back, and in that moment ran into something, hitting his head hard, and blacked out. 1644 PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES I 1645 CH APTER 10 0 1646 PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES I 1647 CH APTER 10 0 1648 PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES I 1649 1651 CH APTER 101 1652 PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES II 1653 CH APTER 101 1654 PRECAUTIONARY MEA SURES II 1655 CH APTER 101 The news of Draco Malfoy nearly being eaten by a horror had been suf- ficient to summon back Dumbledore from wherever he’d gone, to wake Lord Malfoy and the Lady Greengrass’s handsome husband, to bring forth Amelia Bones. The supposed presence of the horror had provoked skepti- cism even from Dumbledore, and the possibility of False Memory Charms had been raised. Harry had said (after some internal debate about the con- sequences of people believing a demon was on the loose) that he didn’t actually remember making the same effort he’d put forth to frighten the Dementor, the dark thing had just left; which was what you would ex- pect someone to create as a False Memory, if they hadn’t actually known how Harry had done it. The names of Bellatrix Black, Severus Snape, and Quirinus Quirrell had been mentioned in connection with wizards strong enough to subdue everyone present and cast False Memory Charms, and Harry had known that Lucius was thinking of Dumbledore. There had been Aurors testifying, and discussions going in circles, and glares of ac- cusation, and cutting remarks at 2 a.m. in the morning. There had been motions, and votes, and consequences. “Do you believe,” Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly to Harry, when all of it was done, and the two of them alone, “that the Hogwarts you have wrought is an improvement?” Harry sat with his elbows on his knees, his face resting on his palms, in the conference room from which all the others had now departed. Pro- fessor McGonagall, who did not use a Time-Turner as routinely as the two of them, had departed swiftly for her bed. “Yes,” Harry answered after too long a hesitation. “From my perspec- tive, Headmaster, things in Hogwarts are finally, finally normal. This is how things should be, when four children get sent into the Forbidden For- est at night. There should be a huge fuss, constables showing up, and the responsible party getting sacked.” “You believe it is good,” Dumbledore said quietly, “that the man who you call responsible was, as you put it, sacked.” “Yes, in fact, I do.” “Argus Filch has served this institution for decades.” “And when given Veritaserum,” Harry said tiredly, “Argus Filch re- vealed that he had sent an eleven-year-old boy into the Forbidden Forest, hoping something awful would happen to him, because he thought the boy’s father had been responsible for the death of his cat. The three other students in Draco’s company don’t seem to have fazed him. I would have argued for jail time, but your concept of jail in this country is Azkaban. I’ll also note that Filch was remarkably unpleasant to the children in Hogwarts and I expect the school’s hedonic index to be improved by his departure, not that it matters to you, I suppose.” The Headmaster’s eyes were impenetrable behind the half-moon glasses. “Argus Filch is a Squib. His work at Hogwarts is all he has. Had, rather.” “The purpose of a school is not to provide work for its employees. I know you probably spent more time around Filch than around any indi- vidual student, but that shouldn’t make Filch’s inner experiences loom larger in your thoughts. Students have inner lives too.” “You don’t care at all, do you Harry?” Dumbledore’s voice was quiet. “About those you hurt.” “I care about the innocent,” Harry said. “Like Mr Hagrid, who you’ll note I argued should not be considered malicious, just oblivious. I was fine with Mr Hagrid working here so long as he didn’t take anyone into the Forbidden Forest again.” “I had thought that with Rubeus vindicated, he might teach Care of Magical Creatures after Silvanus departs the position. But much of that teaching is done in the Forbidden Forest. So that too shall not be, in the wake of your passage.” Harry said slowly, “But—you told us that Mr Hagrid has a blind spot when it comes to magical creatures threatening wizards. That Mr Hagrid had a cognitive deficit and couldn’t really imagine Draco and Tracey get- ting hurt, which was why Mr Hagrid didn’t see anything wrong with leav- ing them alone in the Forbidden Forest at night. Was that not true?” “It is true.” “Then wouldn’t Mr Hagrid be the worst possible teacher for Magical Creatures?” The old wizard gazed down at Harry through the half-moon glasses. His voice was thick when he spoke. “Mr Malfoy himself saw nothing awry. It was not so implausible a trick which Argus played, Harry Potter. And Rubeus might have grown into his position. It would have been—all Rubeus wished, his one greatest desire—” “Your mistake,” Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling at least ten percent as exhausted as he’d ever been, “is a cognitive bias we would call, in the trade, scope insensitivity. Failure to multiply. You’re thinking about how happy Mr Hagrid would be when he heard the news. Consider the next ten years and a thousand students taking Magical Creatures and ten percent of them being scalded by Ashwinders. No one student would be hurt as much as Mr Hagrid would be happy, but there’d be a hundred students being hurt and only one happy teacher.” “Perhaps,” the old wizard said. “And your own error, Harry, is that you do not feel the pain of those you hurt, once you have done your multipli- cation.” “Maybe.” Harry went on staring at his knees. “Or maybe it’s worse than that. Headmaster, what does it mean if a centaur doesn’t like me?” What does it mean when a member of a race of magical creatures known for Divination gives you a lecture on people who are ignorant of consequences, apologizes, and then tries to stab you with a spear? “A centaur?” the Headmaster said. “When did you—ah, the Time- Turner. You are the reason why I could not travel back to before the event, on pain of paradox.” “Am I? I guess I am.” Harry shook his head distantly. “Sorry.” “With very few exceptions,” Dumbledore said, “centaurs do not like wizards, at all.” “This was a bit more specific than that.” “What did the centaur say to you?” Harry didn’t reply. “Ah.” The Headmaster hesitated. “Centaurs have been wrong many times, and if there is anyone in the world who could confuse the stars themselves, it is you.” Harry looked up, and saw the blue eyes once more gentle behind the half-circle glasses. “Do not fret too much about it,” said Albus Dumbledore. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND TWO CARING June 3rd, 1992 Professor Quirrell was very sick. He’d seemed better for a while, after drinking his unicorn’s blood in May, but the air of intense power which had surrounded him after- wards hadn’t lasted even a day. By the Ides of May, Professor Quirrell’s hands had been trembling again, though subtly. The Defence Professor’s medical regimen had been interrupted too early, it seemed. Six days ago Professor Quirrell had collapsed at dinner time. Madam Pomfrey had tried to forbid Professor Quirrell from teaching classes, and Professor Quirrell had shouted at her in front of everyone. The Defence Professor had shouted that he was dying regardless, and would use his remaining time as he chose. So Madam Pomfrey, blinking hard, had forbidden the Defence Pro- fessor from doing anything except teaching his classes. She’d asked for a volunteer to help her take Professor Quirrell to a room in the Hogwarts infirmary. More than a hundred students had risen to their feet, only half wearing green. The Defence Professor no longer sat at the Head Table during meal- times. He didn’t cast spells during lessons. The oldest students who had the most Quirrell points helped him to teach, the seventh-years who had already sat their Defence N.E.W.T.s in May. They took turns floating him from his room in the infirmary to his classes, and brought him food at mealtimes. Professor Quirrell proctored his Battle Magic classes from a chair, sitting. Watching Hermione die had hurt more than this, but that had ended much more quickly. This is the true Enemy. Harry had already thought that, after Hermione had died. Being forced to watch Professor Quirrell die, day by day, week by week, had not done much to change his mind. This is the true Enemy I have to face, Harry thought in Wednesday’s De- fence class, watching Professor Quirrell leaning far to one side of his chair before that day’s seventh-year assistant caught him. Everything else is just shadows and distraction. Harry had been turning over Trelawney’s prophecy in his mind, won- dering if maybe the true Dark Lord had nothing to do with Lord Volde- mort at all. Born to those who have thrice defied him seemed to strongly invoke the Peverell brothers and the three Deathly Hallows—though Harry didn’t exactly see how Death could have marked him as an equal, which seemed to imply some sort of deliberate action on Death’s part. This alone is the true Enemy, Harry thought. After this will come Professor McGonagall, Mum and Dad, even Neville in his time, unless the wound in the world can be healed before then. There was nothing Harry could do. Madam Pomfrey was already do- ing for Professor Quirrell what magic could do, and magic seemed strictly superior to Muggle techniques when it came to healing. There was nothing Harry could do. Nothing he could do. Nothing. Nothing at all. 1662 CARING 1663 CH APTER 10 2 1664 CARING 1665 CH APTER 10 2 1666 CARING 1667 CH APTER 10 2 1668 CARING 1669 CH APTER 10 2 The door to the infirmary closed behind Harry, as the Boy-Who-Lived walked swiftly and with purpose, shrugging on his Invisibility Cloak as he moved. Soon, presumably, Professor Quirrell would call for assistance; and an older student trio would guide the Defence Professor into some quiet place, maybe the forest, with an excuse of viewing the lake or some such. Somewhere the Defence Professor could eat a unicorn undetected, after Harry’s Transfiguration wore off. And then Professor Quirrell would be healthier, for a time. His power would return to him as strong as he’d ever been, for a much shorter time. It wouldn’t last. Harry’s fists clenched as he strode, the tension radiating up his arm muscles. If the Defence Professor’s treatment regimen hadn’t been inter- rupted, by Harry and the Aurors that he had brought to Hogwarts… It was stupid to blame himself, Harry knew it was stupid and some- how his brain was doing it anyway. Like his brain was searching, carefully finding and selecting some way for this to be his fault, no matter how far it had to stretch. As if having things be his fault were the only way that his brain knew how to grieve. A trio of seventh-year Slytherins passed Harry’s invisible form in the hallway, heading for the healer’s offices where the Professor waited, look- ing deeply serious and concerned. Was that how other people grieved? Or did they, on some level, not really care, as Professor Quirrell thought? There is a second level to the Killing Curse. Harry’s brain had solved the riddle instantly, in the moment of first hearing it; as though the knowledge had always been inside him, waiting to make itself known. Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happiness wasn’t sadness, but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that to find happiness in life you asked yourself not what would make you happy, but what would excite you. And by the same reasoning, hatred wasn’t the true opposite of love. Even hatred was a kind of respect that you could give to someone’s existence. If you cared about someone enough to prefer their dying to their living, it meant you were thinking about them. It had come up much earlier, before the Trial, in conversation with Hermione; when she’d said something about magical Britain being Prejudiced, with considerable and recent justification. And Harry had thought—but not said—that at least she’d been let into Hogwarts to be spat upon. Not like certain people living in certain countries, who were, it was said, as human as anyone else; who were said to be sapient beings, worth more than any mere unicorn. But who nonetheless wouldn’t be allowed to live in Muggle Britain. On that score, at least, no Muggle had the right to look a wizard in the eye. Magical Britain might discriminate against Muggle-borns, but at least it allowed them inside so they could be spat upon in person. What is deadlier than hate, and flows without limit? “Indifference,” Harry whispered aloud, the secret of a spell he would never be able to cast; and kept striding toward the library to read anything he could find, anything at all, about the Philosopher’s Stone. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND THREE TESTS June 4th, 1992 Daphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a let- ter to her Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent about power-sharing, despite not even being in Hogwarts to exercise control) when she saw Draco Malfoy stagger in through the portrait door carry- ing what must have been a dozen books, Vincent and Gregory behind him each carrying a dozen more. The Auror who’d accompanied Malfoy stuck his head in briefly, then withdrew to who-knew-where. Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea as he staggered toward her, Vincent and Gregory following after. “Can you help me read these?” said Draco, sounding slightly out of breath as he approached. “What.” Lessons were over, only the exams were left now, and since when did Malfoys ask Greengrasses for help with their homework? “These,” Draco Malfoy said importantly, “are all the library books Miss Granger borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I thought I’d go through them in case there are any Clues there, only then I thought, maybe you should help because you knew Miss Granger better.” Daphne stared at the books. “The General read all that in two weeks?” A twinge of pain went through her heart, but she suppressed it. “Well, I don’t know if Miss Granger finished them all,” Draco said. He held up a cautioning finger. “In fact, we don’t know if she read any of them, or if she really borrowed them, I mean, all we’ve observed is that the library ledger says she checked them out—” Daphne suppressed a groan. Malfoy had been talking like this for weeks. There were some people who clearly were not meant to be in- volved with mysterious murders because it did strange things to their minds. “Mr Malfoy, I couldn’t read all these if I spent my whole summer doing nothing else.” “Then just skim through them, please?” Draco said. “Especially if there’s, you know, mysterious words scribbled in her handwriting, or a bookmark left inside, or—” “I’ve seen those plays too, Mr Malfoy.” Daphne rolled her eyes. “Don’t we have Aurors now for—” “We’re doomed!” shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she burst up from the lower chambers into the Slytherin common room. People paused to look at her. “It’s Professor Quirrell!” A sudden air of attentiveness, as of long-standing disputes about to be settled. “Well, finally,” someone said, as Millicent tried to catch her breath. “He’s only got, what, ten days left to go bad?” “Eleven days,” said the seventh-year who was running the betting pool. “He’s suddenly got a little better and he’s going to summon the first-years for our Defence exam! By surprise! In fifty minutes!” “A Defence exam?” Pansy said blankly. “But Professor Quirrell doesn’t give exams.” “The Ministry Defence exam!” shrieked Millicent. “But Professor Quirrell doesn’t teach anything from the Ministry cur- riculum,” objected Pansy. Daphne was already fleeing to her room, racing for the first-year De- fence textbook that she hadn’t touched since September and screaming curses inside her mind. 1674 TESTS 1675 CH APTER 10 3 Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defence exam. Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some tiny remnant of his childhood, upon reading the first real question (‘How can you make a Shrieking Eel be silent?’). Professor Quirrell’s lessons had spent roughly zero time on the surprising yet useless trivia that some id- iot had imagined a ‘Defence class’ should look like. In principle, Harry could have used his Time-Turner to read through the first-year Defence book after being notified of the surprise exam; but that might have un- fairly skewed the grading curve for others. After staring at the question for a couple of seconds, Harry had written down ‘Quieting Charm’, and included the casting directions in case the Ministry marker didn’t believe that Harry knew it. Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions correctly, the exam had gone by very quickly. The most realistic answer to more than half the questions was ‘Stunning Hex’, and many of the other questions had optimal solutions along the lines of ‘Turn around and walk in the op- posite direction’ or ‘Throw away the cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.’ The last question on the test was “What would you do if you sus- pected there might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?” The Ministry- approved answer, Harry could in fact recall from his read-through of the textbook at the start of the year, was Tell your parents. The problem with this had occurred to Harry right away, which was why Harry had remembered it. After some pondering, Harry wrote down: Dear Ministry marker, I’m afraid the real answer to that is a secret, but rest assured that a Bogeysnake w ould present no more trouble to me than a mountain troll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who. Please inform your superiors that I find your standard answer prejudicial to Muggle- borns, and that I expect this failing will be corrected at once without any need for my direct intervention. Sincerely, the Boy-Who-L ived Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it over into his stack, put down his quill, and sat up. Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be look- ing in his rough direction, though the Defence Professor’s head had nod- ded to one side. The other students were still writing. Some of them were silently crying, but they were still writing. Continuing to fight was also a lesson Professor Quirrell had taught. Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A seventh-year stu- dent went from desk to desk, collecting the exams in Professor Quirrell’s place. The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell sat up straight. “My young students,” he said softly. The seventh-year student had her wand trained on the Defence Professor’s mouth, so that they all heard his voice seeming to come from right beside them. “I know…that prob- ably seemed very fearsome to some of you…it is a different kind of fear from facing the enemy’s wand…you must conquer it separately. So I…shall tell you this now. It is the custom of Hogwarts…that grades are given in the second week of June. But for my case…they can make an exception, I think.” The Defence Professor smiled his familiar dry smile, tinged now as though by a suppressed grimace. “I know you are worried…that you were not prepared for this exam…that my lessons have not covered this mate- rial…and I quite forgot to mention…that it was approaching…though you should have known…it would come in time. But I have just now magically checked…the answers you have given on that…terribly, terribly important exam…though of course only the Ministry grade is official…and assigned your grades for the year taking the results into account…and magically written them down on these parchments,” Professor Quirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the side of his desk, “which will now be handed out…an incredible spell…is it not?” A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but for the most part the students just looked relieved, and some Slytherins were chuckling. Harry would have laughed too, if not for the pain of watching Professor Quirrell gasp out the words. The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell pointed her wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin. The parch- ments rose up and started to drift through the air, separating in mid-flow to drift toward each student. Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and then unfolded it. The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. It was the second-highest grade letter, the highest being Outstanding. In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named Harry would have shouted with indignation about receiving only the second- highest grade. This Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor Quirrell was making some point, and it wasn’t as though the exact grade letter mattered in any other way. Was Professor Quirrell saying that Harry had done relatively well, but not lived up to his full potential? Or was the grade meant to be read literally, that Harry had in fact exceeded the Defence Professor’s expectations? “All of you…pass,” Professor Quirrell said, as the students all looked at their final grades, as sighs of relief rose from desks and Lavender Brown raised her parchment in a clenched fist held high with triumph. “Every student in first-year Battle Magic has passed…except for one.” A number of students looked up in sudden terror. Harry sat there silently. He had seen the point immediately, and even if it was a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would never, ever be talked out of making it. “All of you in this room…have received grades of at least Accept- able. Neville Longbottom…who took this test in the Longbottom home… received a grade of Outstanding. But the other student who is not here… has had a Dreadful grade entered on her record…for failing the only im- portant test…that was given her this year. I would have marked her even lower…but that would have been in poor taste.” The room was very quiet, though a number of students were staring angrily at the Professor. “You may think that a grade of Dreadful…is not fair. That Miss Granger was faced with a test…for which her lessons…had not prepared her. That she was not told…that the exam was coming on that day.” The Defence Professor drew in a shaking breath. “Such is realism,” said Professor Quirrell. “The only important test… may come at any time…be better prepared for it…than she was. As for the rest of you…those who have received Exceeds Expectations or above… have received my letters of recommendation…to certain organizations be- yond Britain’s shores…where your training might be completed. They will contact you…when you are old enough…if you still appear worthy…and if you have not failed an important test. And remember…from this day… you must train yourselves…you cannot rely…on future Defence professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over…you are dismissed.” Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to ignore the excited babble that broke out around him. In time most of the students had departed, and one remained, staying a prescribed distance from the Defence Professor. The Defence Professor opened his eyes. Harry raised the parchment with its EE+, still silent. The Defence Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those tired eyes. “It is the same grade…that I received in my own first year.” “Th, th, th,” Harry couldn’t make the words thank you come out, they were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the Defence Professor tilting his head and giving him an inquiring stare, so Harry just bowed jerkily and then left the room. Nine days yet remained. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR THE TRUTH, PART I: RIDDLES AND ANSW ERS June 13th, 1992 It was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor Quirrell was still alive, barely. The Defence Professor himself would be in a healer’s bed, this day, as he’d been for almost the last week. Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week of June, that results were released in the second week, and that in the third week, there would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday and the Hogwarts Express transporting you to London on Monday. Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he’d first read about that schedule, just what exactly the students did during the rest of the second week of June, since ‘waiting for exam results’ didn’t sound like much; and the answer had surprised him when he’d found out. But now the second week of June was over as well, and it was Saturday; there was nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking Feast on the 14th and the Hogwarts Express ride on the 15th. And nothing had been answered. Nothing had been resolved. Hermione’s killer hadn’t been found. Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth would come out by the end of the school year; like that was the end of a mys- tery novel and the mystery’s answer had been promised him. Certainly it had to be known by the time the Defence Professor…died, it couldn’t be al- lowed for Professor Quirrell to die without knowing the answer, without everything being neatly resolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death, it was only truth that finished a story… But unless you bought Draco Malfoy’s latest theory that Professor Sprout had been assigning and grading less homework around the time of Hermione being framed for attempted murder, thereby proving that Professor Sprout had been spending her time setting it up, the truth remained unfound. And instead, as if the world had priorities that were more like other people’s way of thinking, the year was going to end with a climactic Quid- ditch match. 1682 THE TRUTH I: RIDDLES AND ANSW ERS 1683 CH APTER 104 1684 THE TRUTH I: RIDDLES AND ANSW ERS Second, after second, after second, the time counter incremented. As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of Huf- flepuffs who’d decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry’s banner. As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot of Gryffindors. As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books—he’d given up on the actual game a long time ago—there were a noticeable number of Ravenclaws who’d betrayed patriotism for sanity. And Professor Sinistra. And Professor Vector. And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick. The climactic final Quidditch game of the year…dragged on. 1686 THE TRUTH I: RIDDLES AND ANSW ERS 1687 CH APTER 104 1688 THE TRUTH I: RIDDLES AND ANSW ERS Later, and earlier Harry’s watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45 p.m. after looping back five hours. “It’s time,” Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walking down the third-floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the right- hand side. ‘The place that is prohibited’ would ordinarily mean the Forbidden For- est; that was probably what someone intercepting the message was meant to think. But the Forbidden Forest was huge, and there was more than one distinguished location inside it. No obvious Schelling Point at which to rendezvous, or find some event that needed intervention. But when you added the ‘bloody stupid’ modifier, there was only one prohibited place in Hogwarts that fit. And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumour spoke true, all the first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The third-floor cor- ridor, on the right-hand side. A mysterious door leading to a series of rooms filled with dangerous and potentially lethal traps that nobody could possibly get through, especially if they were only in their first year. Harry didn’t know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on re- flection, meant that the students who’d gone through had been surpris- ingly scrupulous about not ruining the puzzle for others. Maybe there was a sign down there saying Don’t give it away, just as a favour to me, sin- cerely Headmaster Dumbledore. All Harry knew so far was that the outer door would open to Alohomora, and that the final room contained a magic mir- ror that would show your reflection in some situation you found highly appealing, which was apparently the big pay-off. The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light that seemed to come from nowhere, and the arches were covered with cobwebs, as though the corridor hadn’t been used in centuries rather than just the last year. Harry’s pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful wiz- arding things, and everything he’d found that could possibly be a quest item. (Harry had asked Professor McGonagall to recommend someone who could expand the pouch’s capacity, and she’d just done it herself.) Harry had applied the Charm he’d learned for battles that made his eye- glasses stick to his face, regardless of how his head moved. Harry had refreshed the Transfigurations he was maintaining, both the tiny jewel in the ring on his hand and the other one, in case he was knocked uncon- scious. He wasn’t literally ready for anything, but Harry was as ready as he thought he could be. The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry’s shoes and vanished behind him like the future becoming the past. It was almost 6:49—six, and seven in a square. Obvious if you thought in Muggle maths, otherwise not so much. Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something tickled at the back of his mind, and he heard a soft voice talking. “…sensible person…wait until later…after certain faculty had de- parted…” Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not going around the corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell’s voice better. There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again from around the corner. “But if they were also…to depart themselves…at that time…” murmured the voice, “they might think…this final game…makes for the best distraction…left in this year…a predictable distraction. So I looked…to see what people of significance…were not at the game…and I saw the Headmaster missing…but for all my magic can tell me…he could be in another…realm of existence…I also saw your own absence…so I de- cided to go…where you were. That is what I am doing here…now…what are you doing here?” Harry breathed shallowly, and listened. “And just how did you know where I was?” drawled the voice of Severus Snape, so much louder that Harry nearly jumped. A small, coughing laugh. “Check your wand…for Trace.” Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, “You dared tamper with my wand? You dared?” “You are a suspect…just like myself…so your false indignation is wasted…however finely crafted it may be…now tell me…what are you doing?” “I am watching this door,” said the voice of Professor Snape. “And I will ask you to be off from it!” “On whose authority…are you ordering me…my fellow Professor?” There was a pause, then, “Why, the Headmaster’s,” came the smooth voice of Severus Snape. “I was ordered by him to watch this door during the Quidditch match, and as a Professor I must obey his whims. I shall have words about it with the Board of Governors later, but for now I am doing as I must. Now be off with you, as the Headmaster desires.” “What? You mean I am to believe…that you abandoned your Slythe- rins…during their most important…game of the year…and leapt up like a dog…at Dumbledore’s word? Well that…I must say…is entirely plausible. Even so…I think it would be wise…if I kept my own watch over you…while you watch this fine door.” There was a sound of rustling cloth and a soft thud, as if someone had sat down hard upon the ground, or maybe just fallen. “Oh, for the love of Merlin—” Severus Snape’s voice now sounded an- gry. “Get up, you!” “Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh—” said the Defence Professor’s zombie-mode. “Get up!” said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud. Help the watcher of stars— Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that he’d have done so even without an inter-temporal message. Had Professor Snape just kicked Professor Quirrell? That would have been foolhardy if Professor Quirrell had been dead and buried. A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch, set within the dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle would have set a doorknob there was only a handle of polished metal; there were no visible locks, or visible keyholes. Set upon the wall to either side, a pair of torches burned, sending forth an ominous orange glow. Before the door stood the Potions Master in his customary stained robes. Beside the door, to the left side beneath the orange torch, slumped the form of the Defence Professor, back against the wall, head staring out at the sur- roundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway between awareness, and emptiness. “What,” said the towering form of the Potions Master, “are you doing here, Potter?” Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions Master was quite angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry’s co-conspirator in councils to which the Defence Professor had never been invited. “I’m not sure,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure what role he should be play- ing, and was, in desperation, falling back on simple honesty. “I think per- haps I’m supposed to be keeping an eye on the Defence Professor.” The Potions Master stared at him coldly. “Where’s your escort, Potter? Students are not to wander these halls alone!” Harry’s mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobody had told him the rules. “I’m not sure how to answer that…” The cold expression on Professor Snape’s face flickered. “Perhaps I should call the Aurors,” he said. “Wait!” Harry blurted. The Potions Master’s hand hovered about his robes. “Why?” said the Potions Master. “I…I just think you probably shouldn’t call them…” In a blur, the Potions Master’s wand was in his hand. “Nullus confun- dio!” A black jet darted out and hit Harry, striking in the direction Harry had already started to dodge. There followed four other spells, containing words like Polyfluis and Metamorphus; and for those Harry politely stood still. After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect, Severus Snape was staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now seemed genuine. “I sug- gest,” the Potions Master said softly, “that you explain yourself, Potter.” “I can’t explain myself,” Harry said. “I don’t have the Time, not yet.” Harry looked directly into the Potions Master’s gaze as he said the words myself and time, widening his own eyes to try to convey the key information, and the Potions Master hesitated. Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to be what. Since Professor Quirrell wasn’t in on Dumbledore’s conspiracy, Se- verus was pretending to be the evil Potions Master of Hogwarts, who’d been sent here by the Headmaster…and might or might not have actually been sent here by Dumbledore…but Professor Quirrell either thought, or was pretending to think, that someone needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape…and Harry himself had been sent here by future-Harry and had no idea why…and why were they all standing outside the Headmaster’s forbidden door in the first place? And then… From behind where Harry stood… Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and many- fold. Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of darkness that shrouded where the Defence Professor was lying. “Muffliato,” the Po- tions Master hissed. “Mr Potter, if you must be here, then hide! Put on your invisibility cloak! My duty is to guard this door in case he comes here. And there has been—a disturbance, meant to draw the Headmaster, he thinks—” “Who—” Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against the side of Harry’s head. There was a trickling sensation like an egg had been cracked over him, the feeling of a Disillusionment Charm; and Harry’s hands faded out, followed by the rest of him. The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow mist, and there was again visible the huddled form of the Defence Professor, who said nothing. Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to watch. The approaching footsteps rounded the corner— “What are you doing here?” came many simultaneous cries. Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff yellow stood Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Tracey Davis. “Where,” said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, “are your escorts, children? First-years must be accompanied by a sixth or seventh-year stu- dent at all times! Especially you!” Theodore Nott raised his hand. “We’re, um,” said Theodore Nott. “We’re doing what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building exercise…see, we realized just now that none of us had tried the Headmaster’s forbid- den chamber yet, and there wasn’t much time left…and Harry Potter has authorized it, Professor, he said specifically that you mustn’t interfere.” Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had tip- toed; a storm seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark fury in his eyes. I…maybe? There was still one hour left on Harry’s Time-Turner, so it was possible. “Harry Potter does not have that authority,” the Potions Master said in a deceptively mild tone. “Explain yourselves, now.” “Really?” said the form of Susan Bones. “Really? You’re telling Profes- sor Snape that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that’s your idea of a bluff?” The young Hufflepuff turned to Professor Snape and spoke, her voice strangely firm. “Professor, this is the truth and it’s urgent. Draco Malfoy is missing and we think he went down there—” “If Mr Malfoy is missing,” said Professor Snape, “why have the Aurors not been notified?” “Because of, because of reasons!” cried Daphne Greengrass. “There’s no time, you’ve got to let us through!” Professor Snape’s voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever heard it. “Are you four morons under the impression that you are on some sort of adventure? Well, you are mistaken. I assure you that Mr Malfoy has not passed through this door.” “We think Mr Malfoy has an invisibility cloak,” Susan Bones said rapidly. “Do you remember the door seeming to open for no reason?” “No,” the Potions Master said. “Now be gone from here. This place is off-limits for today.” “This is Dumbledore’s forbidden corridor,” Tracey said. “The Headmas- ter himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you think you are, forbidding it too?” “Miss Davis,” said the Potions Master, “you need to stop associating with Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender Brown. And if you are still here in one minute, I will file papers requesting your transfer into that House.” “You wouldn’t dare!” shrieked Tracey. “Hm,” Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration. “Pro- fessor Snape, do you occasionally open the door yourself, to check on whatever’s inside?” Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right hand on the metal knocker— Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn’t notice what Professor Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard the sudden cry. “No, in fact,” said Professor Snape, now holding the choking head of Draco Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was still underneath his invisibility cloak. “A fine try, though.” “What?” cried Tracey and Daphne. Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. “I can’t believe I fell for that.” “So, Mr Malfoy,” Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered. “You sent your friends here on a ruse…just in the hopes that you could pass through this door? Now why would you do that?” “I think we should trust him—” said Theodore Nott. “Mr Malfoy, we’ve got to trust him, he’s the one Professor who would take our side!” “No!” cried Draco’s floating head, from where Professor Snape was still grasping his collar. “You mustn’t say anything! Stop!” “We’ve got to take the chance!” yelled Theodore. “Professor Snape, Mr Malfoy finally worked out what’s been going on this whole year, and why—Dumbledore is trying to get the Philosopher’s Stone away from Nicholas Flamel! Because Dumbledore doesn’t think anyone ought to have immortality! So Dumbledore tried to convince Flamel that the Dark Lord was coming back and needed the Stone to revive, and asked Flamel to give it to him, but Flamel wouldn’t, and instead Flamel put the Stone in the magic mirror that’s down there, and Dumbledore is finding out right now how to get it, and then he’ll come for it and we’ve got to get to it first! Dumbledore really will be all-powerful if he gets the Philosopher’s Stone!” “What?” said Tracey. “That’s not what you said before!” “It—” Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. “It doesn’t matter—Professor Snape, please, you have to believe me. I looked at the books Hermione checked out of the library, and she was research- ing the Philosopher’s Stone just before someone killed her. Her notes said that something dangerous might happen if the Stone stays inside the mirror too long. We have to get it out of the castle right away.” Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. “I’m not with them, I just came along to prevent anything even stupider from happening.” Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then he turned his head to look at Draco Malfoy. “Mr Malfoy,” the Potions Master drawled. “How did you come to discover Dumbledore’s plot?” “I deduced it from evidence!” said Draco Malfoy’s floating head. Professor Snape’s head swivelled back to Theodore Nott. “How did you intend to obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that could suppos- edly baffle Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!” “We’re going to take the whole mirror and send it back to Flamel,” said Theodore Nott. “It’s not like we want the Stone for ourselves, we just need to stop Dumbledore from stealing it.” Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, and turned his head to look at the other students. “Tell me, have any of you noticed one of the others behaving in an unusual fashion? Especially if there is a peculiar object that they have in their possession, or they can use spells a first-year should not know?” Professor Snape’s right hand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones. “I see that Miss Greengrass and Miss Davis are trying not to look at you, Miss Bones. If there is a mundane explanation, you would be wise to offer it immediately.” Susan Bones’s hair turned bright red, though her face didn’t change. “I suppose there’s not much point keeping it mum any longer,” she said, “since I’m graduating in two days anyway.” “Double witches get to graduate six years early?” said Tracey Davis. “That’s not fair!” “Bones is a double witch?” cried Theodore. “No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus,” Professor Snape said. “Masquerading as another student is extremely against reg- ulation, as you are well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late to expel you from Hogwarts two days before your graduation, which would be a dreadful tragedy—from your perspective, that is. From my perspective it would be hilarious. Now tell me what exactly you are doing here.” “That explains it,” said Daphne Greengrass. “Um, is there actually a Susan Bones, or is the House dying out so they had you secretly—” The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. “Yes, Miss Greengrass, there’s a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in when you lot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of trouble. Professor Snape, the reason I’m here is because Draco Malfoy was missing, and this lot insisted on trying to find him instead of calling the Aurors. For rea- sons the real Miss Bones said there was no time to explain to me, which I now realize were stupid. But young students must never go alone, and must be accompanied by a sixth- or seventh-year at all times. And now we found Draco Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets any more ridiculous?” “What in Merlin’s name is going on here?” “Ah,” said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at the red- haired form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping the collar below the disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing next to the crumpled form of the Defence Professor. “Professor Sprout, I perceive.” “It’s not what it looks like,” volunteered Tracey Davis. The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed forwards. She had, by this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn’t pointing it at anyone. “I don’t even know what this looks like! Down wands, all of you, right now! Including you, Professor!” Distraction. The thought came to Harry with sudden clarity. Whatever he was watching now, from where he stood invisibly and well back of the action, it wasn’t what was really going on, it wasn’t the true thread of the story, it had been arranged. Professor Sprout’s arrival had broken Harry’s suspension of disbelief; things like that didn’t happen just for the sake of comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately causing all this chaos, but what was the point? Harry really hoped he hadn’t gone back in time and done this, because it did seem like the sort of thing he would do. Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand released Draco Mal- foy. “Professor Sprout,” the Potions Master said, “I am here on the Head- master’s orders to watch this door. Everyone else present is not supposed to be here, and I ask you to see them cleared away.” “A likely story,” snapped Professor Sprout. “Why would Dumbledore set you of all people to guard the door to his playground? It’s not as if he wants to keep the students out, oh no, they need to go in and get stuck in my Devil’s Snare! Susan, dear, you’ve got a communications mirror, don’t you? Use it to call the Aurors.” The watching Harry nodded to himself. That was the point. The Aurors would take away everyone present at this terribly confusing situation, no excuses accepted, and then the door would be unguarded. But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself? Or watch, to see who finally came once all the others were gone? A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at where the Defence Professor lay. “Snape…listen…” said the Defence Professor between coughs. “Why… Sprout…here…” The Potions Master looked down. “Memory Charm—implies—Professor—” The Defence Professor be- gan coughing again. “What?” And the logic unfolded in Harry’s mind in crystalline dismay, all the steps already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as a repetition with greater confidence. Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she’d tried to kill Draco. Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm. So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimize or Imperius a Hogwarts Professor. And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head of House Hufflepuff. Snape’s head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her wand, and the Potions Master managed to raise a wordless translucent ward between them. But the bolt that shot from Professor Sprout’s wand was a dark brown that produced a surge of awful apprehension in Harry’s mind; and the brown bolt made Severus’s shield wink out before they touched, clipping the Potions Master’s right arm even as he dodged. Professor Snape gave a muffled shriek and his hand spasmed, dropping his wand. The next bolt that came from Sprout’s wand was a bright red the colour of a Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster even as it left her wand, accompanied by another surge of anxiety; and that blew the Potions Master into the door, dropping him motionless to the ground. By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a multi- faceted blue haze and she was firing hex after hex at Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout was ignoring the hexes to summon plant tendrils that entangled the younger students as they tried to run, except Draco Malfoy, who had again vanished beneath his invisibility cloak. Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She levelled her wand, took a deep breath, and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden worms of light chewing into the shield around Professor Sprout. At that the Herbol- ogy Professor turned to face not-Susan, her expression vacant, a new set of plant tentacles rising in the air behind her. Those stalks were a darker green, and seemed to have shields of their own. Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, “Attack Sprout. Help Bones. Non-lethal only.” “Yes, my lord,” whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry’s Cloak of Invisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin’s presence moved off toward the fight. Harry looked down at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of unpleasant shock that his Disillusionment Charm wasn’t as complete as it had been before. There were hints of distortion in the air, each time Harry moved… Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, and ducked behind a wall. Then he took out his communications mirror… which was blank and jammed. Of course. Harry levitated the mirror to where he could use it to see around the corner, and watch the end of the… distraction? What was happening, why? Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were duelling in flashes of light and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater Drill Hex erupted from mid-air and chewed halfway through the outer layer of Professor Sprout’s shields. The Herbology Professor turned and fired a broad wash of yellow at where the Drill Hex had come from, but the spell didn’t seem to hit anything. Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant tendrils and swirling pur- ple flower petals… It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in all di- rections that one of the crimson blades caught something in mid-air, the Invisibility Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc was absorbed and winked out; and Lesath’s presence beneath the Invisibility Cloak fell to the ground. And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catch her breath, and scream something that inspired in Harry another surge of dread; and the white spark that blazed forth went through Professor Sprout’s chewed shields and her plant-armour and dropped her. Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked in sweat. Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned on the floor or wrapped in vines. “What,” said not-Susan. “What. What. What.” There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout’s vines weren’t moving, though they did seem to be breathing. “Malfoy…” said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping for breath. “Draco Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the Aurors already! Mer- lin damn it—Hominem Revelio!” And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at the form of Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak, standing behind not-Susan, pointing his wand at a gap in not-Susan’s blue haze. Harry’s mind moved in flashes of rapid insight, and yet too slow; even as Harry’s mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to shout… beware the constellation there was a constellation named Draco if you could control a Professor you could control a student “Duck!” Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of red light caught the back of not-Susan’s head point-blank, smashing her to the floor. Harry stepped around the corner and said, “Somnium Somnium Som- nium Somnium Somnium Somnium.” Draco Malfoy’s shimmering form collapsed in a heap. Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said “Stupefy!” and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did hit Draco Malfoy’s form. (You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit. Harry had seen enough horror films, not to mention the business with the Sunshine Regiment, that he wasn’t about to make that error again.) After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning Hex into the prostrate form of Professor Sprout. Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily from the exhaustion. He didn’t have enough magic left to cast a messenger Patronus to Dumbledore and he really really should have thought of that possibility immediately this time around. Harry started to reach back to where his mirror had fallen, to see if it was now unjammed. And then Harry hesitated. His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and Harry still did not know what was going on. The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of rack- ing coughs, reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and slowly pulled himself to his feet. “Harry,” croaked Professor Quirrell. “Harry. Are you there?” It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by his first name. “I’m here,” Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet were moving forward. “Please,” said Professor Quirrell. “Please, I haven’t…much time. Please take me…to the mirror…help me…get the Stone.” “The Philosopher’s Stone?” Harry said. He glanced around at the scattered bodies, but he couldn’t see Draco any more, the revealment had worn off. “You think Mr Nott was right? I don’t think Dumbledore would—” “Not—Dumbledore,” gasped Professor Quirrell. “Because—Sprout—” “I understand,” Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one behind it all, he wouldn’t have needed to mind-control a Professor in order to use Memory Charms. “Mirror…ancient relic…could hide anything…Stone could be there… many others want Stone…one sent Sprout…” Harry repeated rapidly, “The mirror down there is an ancient relic that can be used to hide things, and it would be one possible place to hide the Philosopher’s Stone. If the Philosopher’s Stone is inside the mirror then any number of people might want to get it. One of them is controlling Sprout and that would explain what their goal really is…only…that doesn’t explain why Sprout’s controller would go after Hermione?” “Harry, please,” Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet more laboured now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. “It’s the one thing…that can save my life…and I find, now…I don’t want to die…please, help me…” And somehow that tore it. Somehow that was a little too much. The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when Professor Sprout had arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was returning; his Inner Critic weighing up everything as though it were a set-piece. Tim- ing, probability, so many people showing up at the same door, the De- fence Professor’s desperation…this whole situation didn’t feel real. But he might be able to solve it if he just took time to think things through in ad- vance, instead of running off at adventure’s first call. All the accumulated experience from the last year had finally crystallized into something like a touch of battle hardening. An instinct born of past disaster was telling Harry that if he just rushed on ahead, he would end up afterwards in a sad conversation, realizing that he’d been stupid. Again. “Let me think,” Harry said. “Let me think for a minute before we go.” He turned away from the Defence Professor, looking at the unconscious bodies draped in various shapes over the floor. There’d been so many puz- zle pieces already, this last year, maybe everything would just fall into place with one more piece… “Harry…” the Defence Professor said in a faltering voice. “Harry, I’m dying…” One more minute can’t make the difference he’s had the whole year to be sick it’s improbable that his life versus death would be precisely timed to rest on this last minute no matter what happened to Hermione— “I know!” Harry said. “I’ll think quickly!” Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time for doubts, for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the first thoughts and run with them— In the back of Harry’s mind, fragments of abstract thought flitted past, heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time to rehearse in words. In wordless flashes they shot past, to set up the object-level problem. —what do I notice I am confused by— —the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect of the situation seems most improbable— —simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate improbabilities that must be postulated— Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell had arrived then Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the adventuring party had arrived and Draco had been revealed (part of the party) then Professor Sprout had shown up. Too many people had shown up synchronously and that was too much coincidence, it was improbable that so many different parties would show up at the same location within a five-minute window, there had to be hid- den entanglements. Label Sprout’s controller as the mastermind who had ordered Hermi- one Memory-Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout. Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to guard the door after there’d been some sort of disturbance, if the mastermind had caused that as a distraction then that explained Severus’s presence as well. Harry wasn’t sure any more that Draco had been controlled by the mas- termind, that hypothesis had come to him on the spur of the moment, Draco might have just been trying to drop not-Susan so he could get into the corridor unhindered— No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to explain the timed presence of Draco and his adventuring party, no time for self- questioning, run with the hypothesis, therefore suppose Sprout’s master- mind had sent Draco or triggered his coming. That was three arrivals explained. Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to do so. That could be attributed to time travel. That left the Defence Professor who’d said he was following Snape, only that didn’t really seem like an adequate reason for Professor Quirrell to show up it didn’t really make Harry feel less confused and so maybe the mastermind had also controlled the timing of Professor Quirrell’s pres- ence somehow and even arranged for Harry himself to enter the time loop. Harry’s mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn’t see how to extend that reasoning further. There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks. Without any pause or braking Harry’s mind attacked the problem from a new angle. Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor from the need for some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which meant that Professor Sprout’s controller had framed and then murdered Hermi- one which meant Professor Sprout’s controller had detailed information about Hogwarts life and maybe a personal interest in the Boy-Who-Lived and his friends. Harry’s mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore say- ing that Lord Voldemort’s strongest road to life was hidden here inside Hogwarts run with the hypothesis so that resurrection tool was the Philoso- pher’s Stone hidden inside the mirror why had Dumbledore put the mirror into a corridor first-years could get through no ignore this question it’s not impor- tant right now and Professor Quirrell had said the Philosopher’s Stone pos- sessed great healing power so that part also fit. But if it was the Philosopher’s Stone that was hidden in the mirror to keep it away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror also contained the one thing in the world that could save the Defence Professor’s life— Harry’s mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden appre- hension as to where this was going. But there was no time allowed for hesitation. —and that was also far too much coincidence just too much improba- bility if your mind didn’t write it off as an amazing plot twist like you were inside a story. Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor Quirrell so that Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed salvation at the right time so that Harry and Professor Quirrell would go get the resur- rection tool from the mirror that might not even actually be the Philoso- pher’s Stone and then the Dark Lord’s avatar or some other servant would show up and seize it from them that would explain all the synchronies and negate every coincidence. Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the one thing that could save his life was hidden inside this mirror and that was why he had agreed to teach Defence at Hogwarts and now he was finally trying to get it but then why wait until he was this sick to even try and why had Sprout shown up at the same time as Professor Quirrell— Harry’s mind faltered harder. His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to look. The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I wouldn’t send myself a note saying that, if I hadn’t already worked out in the future that it was the right thing to do—maybe the note is just telling me to get on with it— A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious attention. The coded message on the parchment…one or two lines hadn’t quite sounded right, hadn’t sounded like the code Harry would expect himself to use… “Harry,” whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from behind him. “Harry, please.” “I’m almost done thinking,” Harry’s voice said aloud, and Harry real- ized as he spoke the words that they were true. Turn it around. Look at it from the Enemy’s perspective, from where the Enemy does their own intelligent planning, somewhere out of your sight. There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is now fully on guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first sign of trouble, or send a Patronus to Albus Dumbledore. Considering that as a puzzle, one creative solution is to— —forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter from him- self, telling Harry Potter not to call for help, telling him to be at the place and time you want him to be. You get the target himself to bypass all the protections he set up. You even bypass his protection of skepticism with the overriding authority of his own future self’s judgement. It isn’t even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random student into remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to be given back to himself later. You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a Hogwarts Pro- fessor. You don’t go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle paper from Harry Potter’s pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter’s handwriting on wizard parchment. You can forge Harry Potter’s handwriting because you have seen it on Ministry-mandated exams you have graded. You call Draco Malfoy ‘the constellation’ because you know Harry Pot- ter is interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have taken Astronomy and memorised the names of all the constellations. But it’s not the natural code that Harry Potter would use to describe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would have been ‘the apprentice’. You call Professor Quirrell ‘the watcher of stars’, and tell Harry Potter to help him. You know that life-eater is how you say ‘Dementor’ in Parseltongue and you expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as being in league with them. You encode 6:49 as ‘six, and seven in a square’ because you have been reading a Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you. Who are you, then? Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and, heart racing for a mo- ment, slowed his breath down again; Professor Quirrell was watching him. What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the master- mind and had faked Harry’s message then that explained all five parties showing up the whole synchronous coordination of the comedy and then Professor Sprout was just controlled to give Professor Quirrell deniability let him blame someone else for the False Memory Charm after the dust settled but But why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry had with Draco via the attempted murder-frame (that Professor Quirrell had ‘detected’ and ‘stopped’ allegedly via a tracer put on Draco) Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione (if his first attempt to remove her hadn’t worked) If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied about ev- erything to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn’t coincidence at all that the only thing that could save his life was the avenue that could resurrect the Dark Lord what if the Dark Lord had arranged that too somehow (one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumed dead at the Dark Lord’s hands) An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from all the reasoning he’d done so far, an intuition that Harry couldn’t put into words; except that he and the Defence Professor were very much alike in certain ways, and faking a Time-Turned message was just the sort of cre- ative method that Harry himself might have tried to bypass all of a target’s protections— And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been obvi- ous from the very, very beginning. And And And Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix Black had thought identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the Boy-Who- Lived a sense of doom and his magic interacted destructively with Harry’s and his favourite spell was Avada Kedavra and and and— The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking, releas- ing out all its water, bursting through his mind in an irresistible flood that swept everything away. There is only one reality that generates all of the observations. If different observations seem to point in incompatible directions, it means the true hypothesis is one you haven’t thought of yet. And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct hypothesis, everything aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror, tearing away every doubt and every emotion that might stand in its path. —and then ‘David Monroe’ and ‘Lord Voldemort’ had just been one person playing both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why the Monroe family had been killed before they could meet ‘David Monroe’ just like Moody had suspected— Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent state-of- affairs that compactly generated the observation set. Harry didn’t jump, didn’t change his breathing, tried not to show a single sign of the horror and agony flooding his mind. The Enemy was behind him, watching him. “All right,” Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his voice to sound normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking away from Profes- sor Quirrell, because Harry didn’t trust his own face. Harry lifted a sleeve to wipe away the sweat on his forehead, trying to make the gesture look casual; Harry couldn’t control the sweat, or the rapid hammering in his chest. “Let’s go get the Philosopher’s Stone.” All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere along the way to use his Time-Turner. There was no reply from behind him. The silence stretched. Slowly, Harry turned around. Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling. In the Defence Professor’s hand was a shape of black metal pointed at Harry’s wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who knew exactly how to use a semi-automatic handgun. Harry’s mouth was dry, even his lips were trembling with adrenaline, but he managed to speak. “Hello, Lord Voldemort.” Professor Quirrell inclined his head in acknowledgement, and said, “Hello, Tom Riddle.” CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND FI V E THE TRUTH, PART II Tom Riddle. The words seemed to echo inside Harry’s head, sparking res- onances that as quickly died away, broken patterns trying to complete themselves and failing. Tom Riddle is a Tom Riddle was the Riddle There were other priorities occupying Harry’s attention. Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him. And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn’t fired it yet. Harry’s voice came out in more of a croak. “What is it that you want from me?” “Your death,” said Professor Quirrell, “is clearly not what I am about to say, since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I wished. The fateful battle between Lord Voldemort and the Boy-Who-Lived is a figment of Dumble- dore’s imagination. I know where to find your family’s house in Oxford, and I am familiar with the concept of sniper rifles. You would have died before you ever touched a wand. I hope this is clear to you, Tom?” “Crystal,” Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running pro- grams more suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate spells or thinking. But Harry could think of one thing the person pointing a gun at him ob- viously wanted him to do, a question that person was waiting for him to ask, and Harry did so. “Why are you calling me Tom?” Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. “Why am I calling you Tom? Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped for, but it should suffice for this.” Harry’s mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain could manage to focus on the question. “Tom Riddle is your name. Our name. That’s who Lord Voldemort is, or was, or—something.” Professor Quirrell nodded. “Better. You have already vanquished the Dark Lord, the one and only time that you will ever do so. I have already destroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter, eliminating the difference between our spirits and enabling us to reside in the same world. Now that it is clear to you that the battle between us is a lie, you might act sensibly to advance your own interests. Or you might not.” The gun jabbed slightly forward, causing prickles of sweat to appear on Harry’s forehead. “Drop your wand. Now.” Harry dropped it. “Step away from the wand,” said Professor Quirrell. Harry obeyed. “Reach toward your neck,” said Professor Quirrell, “and remove your Time-Turner, touching it by the chain only. Place the Time-Turner on the ground, then step away from it as well.” This also Harry did. Even in his state of shock, his mind still looked for a way to spin the Time-Turner in the process, a sudden move that would win; but Harry knew that Professor Quirrell would already be imagining himself in Harry’s position, looking for the same possible opportunities. “Remove your pouch and place it also on the ground, then step away.” Harry did this. “Very good,” said the Defence Professor. “Now. It is time for me to ob- tain the Philosopher’s Stone. I mean to bring along these four first-years here, suitably Obliviated of their most recent memories so that they still recall their original purpose. Snape I shall control and set to guard this door. After this day’s work is done, I intend to kill Snape for the betray- als he has offered my other identity. The three heir-children I shall take with me afterwards, to shape their future loyalties. And know this, I have taken hostages. I have already set in motion a spell that will kill hundreds of Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I can stop that spell using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully. If I am interrupted before then, or if I choose not to stop the spell, hundreds of students will die.” Professor Quirrell’s voice was still mild. “Do you yet perceive any inter- ests you have at stake, boy? I would smile to hear you say ‘no’, but that is too much to hope.” “I’d like,” Harry managed to say, through the horror, and the heart- break, and the knives slicing away at an emotional connection that hurt like living flesh as it was cut, “for you not to do those things, Professor.” Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why did it have to turn out like this, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t want this to be happening… “Very well,” Professor Quirrell said. “I grant you permission to offer me something I want.” The gun gestured invitingly. “That is a rare privi- lege, child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate for what he wants.” Some part of Harry’s mind scrabbled frantically, looking for some- thing, anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort or Pro- fessor Quirrell than child hostages or Severus’s death. Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking, already knew his answer. “You already have an idea for what you want from me,” Harry said, through the sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul. “What is it?” “Your help in obtaining the Philosopher’s Stone.” Harry swallowed. He couldn’t stop his eyes from going to the gun, then back up at Professor Quirrell’s face. He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say ‘No’, but now that he was actually in a situation like this, saying ‘No’ didn’t seem to make sense. “I am disappointed that you need to think about this,” said Professor Quirrell. “It is straightforward that you should obey me for now, since I hold every advantage over you. I have taught you better than this; in this situation you should certainly pretend to lose. You can expect to gain nothing by resisting, except pain. You should have calculated that it was better to answer sooner, and not earn my distrust.” Professor Quirrell’s eyes studied him curiously. “Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your ears with nonsense about noble defiance? I find such morals amusing, since they are so easy to manipulate. I assure you that I can make defiance seem morally worse, and you would be well advised to submit before I demonstrate how.” The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a wave of Professor Quirrell’s other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air, spun lazily, her limbs spread-eagled— —then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry’s heart, Tracey floated back down again. “Choose,” said Professor Quirrell. “This begins to try my patience.” I should have spoken just then, before he might’ve ripped off Tracey’s legs, no, I shouldn’t have, the Headmaster said I mustn’t show Lord Voldemort that I’ll do things if he threatens my friends because that will just make him threaten more of them—only what he said before isn’t a threat it’s just the sort of thing Lord Volde- mort does— Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of him kept on running on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of his mind that it could not afford to stay in shock. Shocks were of finite duration, neurons kept firing regardless, the only reason Harry’s mind would shut down while his brain kept running was if Harry’s self-model believed his mind would shut down— “I don’t mean to try your patience,” Harry said. His voice was cracking. That was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant that Lord Volde- mort might give him more time. “But if Lord Voldemort had a reputation for keeping his bargains, I don’t know about it.” “An obvious concern,” Professor Quirrell said. “There is a simple an- swer, and I would have enforced it upon you in any case. Snakess can't lie. And since I have a tremendous distaste for stupidity, I suggest you do not say anything like ‘What do you mean?’ You are smarter than that, and I do not have time for such conversations as ordinary people inflict on one another.” Harry swallowed. Snakes can’t lie. “Two pluss two equalss four.” Harry had tried to say that two plus two equalled three, and the word four had slipped out instead. “Good. When Salazar Slytherin invoked the Parselmouth curse upon himself and all his children, his true plan was to ensure his descendants could trust one another’s words, whatever plots they wove against out- siders.” Professor Quirrell had adopted his lecturing pose from Battle Magic, like someone putting on a well-worn mask, but the gun remained pointed in his hand. “Occlumency cannot fool the Parselmouth curse as it can fool Veritaserum, and you may put that to the trial also. Now listen well. Come with me, promisse your besst aid in getting Stone, and I sshall leave thesse children behind unharmed. Hosstagess are real, hundredss of sstudentss die tonight unlesss I sstop eventss already sset in motion. Will sspare hosstagess if I obtain Stone ssuccesssfully. And mark also this, mark it well: I cannot be truly sslain by any power known to me, and lossing Stone will not sstop me from returning, nor sspare you or yourss my wrath. Any impetuous act you are contemplating cannot win the game for you, boy. I do credit your ability to annoy me, and suggest you avoid doing so.” “You said,” Harry’s voice was strange in his own ears, “that the Philoso- pher’s Stone had different powers from what legend said. You said that to me in Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really does, before I agree to help you get it.” If it was something along the lines of gaining total power over the universe, then nothing was worth an incrementally greater chance of Lord Voldemort getting the Stone. “Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. “You are thinking. That is better, and as a reward I shall offer you a further incentive for coopera- tion. Eternal life and youth, the creation of gold and silver. Suppose these are true benefits of holding the Stone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone’s power?” It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually useful for his brain for once. It might have been the power of being told that an answer existed, and that the evidence wasn’t a lie. “It can make Transfig- urations permanent.” Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just said. “Correct,” said Professor Quirrell. “Thus, whoever holds the Philoso- pher’s Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration.” Harry’s torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized what further incentive would be offered him. “You stole Miss Granger’s remains and Transfigured them into some innocuous-appearing target,” said Professor Quirrell. “A Transfigured target that you must keep somewhere about your own person, in order to sustain the Transfiguration. Ah, I see your eyes going to that ring upon your hand, but of course Miss Granger would not be the little jewel set into the ring, would it? That would be too obvious. No, I expect you Transfigured Granger’s remains into the ring itself, letting the aura of the Transfigured jewel mask the magic in the Transfigured ring.” “Yes,” Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once, and Harry’s glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone to chal- lenge him on the steel ring, he’d tried to provoke that challenge so he could prove to be innocent yet again, though nobody had taken him up on it—maybe Dumbledore had just sensed that the steel by itself wasn’t magical. “Fine and good,” said Professor Quirrell. “Now come with me, help me to obtain the Stone, and I will resurrect Hermione Granger on your behalf. Her death has had unfortunate effects on you, and I would not mind undoing them. That, as I understand you, is your greatest desire. I have done you many kindnesses, and I would not mind doing you this one more.” A blank-eyed Professor Sprout had now risen from the ground and was pointing her own wand at Harry. “Help me obtain Stone of Transsfig- uration, and I sshall try my hardesst to ressurrect your girl-child friend to true and lassting life. That ssaid, boy, I am sswiftly running out of patience with you, and you sshall not like what comess next.” This last line was hissed out in a voice that conveyed the impression of a snake rearing its head to strike. 1716 THE TRUTH II 1717 CH APTER 105 After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry’s wand, and wrapped it in shimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again pointed her wand at Harry. Only then did Professor Quirrell lower his gun, which seemed to disappear into his hand, and pick up Harry’s wrapped wand, tucking it into his robes. The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping form of Lesath Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as well as Harry’s pouch and Time-Turner. Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the mass version of the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the subject fill in the blanks using their own suggestibility, on all the students present. Af- terwards Professor Sprout floated away the sleeping children, now wear- ing an expression that seemed annoyed and preoccupied, as if they’d been in some Herbology accident. Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master lay sprawled, bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape’s forehead. “Alienis nervus mobile lignum.” The Defence Professor stepped back, and began to move his left fin- gers in the air as though manipulating a puppet on strings. Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth mo- tions, and stood once more before the corridor door. “Alohomora,” Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand at the forbid- den door. The Defence Professor looked rather amused. “Would you do the honours, boy?” Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, and third thoughts. It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it was the wrong thing, not the selfish thing but the wrong thing to do on some deeper level. But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more ap- peared in his hand at Harry’s hesitation. Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deep breaths, again composing his mind as best he could. Go through with it, don’t get shot, don’t let the hostages die, be there to optimize events, be there to watch for opportunities and stay capable of taking them. It wasn’t a good choice, but all the other ones seemed worse. Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND SIX THE TRUTH, PART III After a single step into Dumbledore’s forbidden chamber, Harry shrieked and jumped back and collided with Professor Snape, sending the two of them down in a heap. Professor Snape picked himself up and resumed standing in front of the door. His head tracked to look at Harry. “I am guarding this door at the Headmaster’s orders,” said Professor Snape in his usual sardonic tones. “Be off with you at once, or I shall deduct House Points.” This was bone-chillingly creepy, but Harry’s attention was occupied by the gigantic three-headed dog which had lunged forward, only to be stopped metres from Harry by the chains upon its three collars. “That—that—that—” Harry said. “Yes,” Professor Quirrell said from some way behind him, “that is in- deed the usual occupant of that chamber, which is off-limits to all stu- dents, especially first-years.” “That’s not safe even by wizard standards!” Within the chamber, the enor- mous black beast gave a multi-voiced bellow, flecks of white saliva flying from three fanged mouths. Professor Quirrell sighed. “It is enchanted not to eat students, just spit them back out through the door. Now, boy, how would you recommend that we deal with this dangerous creature?” “Uh,” Harry stuttered, trying to think over the continued roaring of the chamber’s guardian. “Uh. If it’s like the Cerberus from the Muggle legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, then we have to sing it to sleep so we can pass—” “Avada Kedavra.” The three-headed beast fell over. Harry looked back at Professor Quirrell, who was giving him a look of extreme disappointment, as if to ask whether Harry had attended any of his classes, ever. “I sort of assumed,” Harry said, still trying to catch his breath, “that going through this challenge in any way except the one used by first-years, might perhaps trigger an alarm.” “That is a lie, boy, you simply did not remember your lessons when you faced the occasion in true life. As for alarms, I have spent months befuddling all the wards and tripsigns upon these chambers.” “Then why did you send me in first, exactly?” Professor Quirrell just smiled. It looked significantly more evil than usual. “Never mind,” Harry said, and walked slowly into the chamber, his limbs still shaking. The chamber was all of stone, illuminated by a pale blue light that shone from arched nooks carved into the wall; as if the light of a grey sky were passing through windows, though there were no windows. At the far end of the chamber was a wooden trapdoor upon the floor, with a single ring attached. In the middle of the chamber lay a gigantic dead dog with three lifeless heads. Harry turned toward one of the arched nooks and looked inside it. There was nothing there but the sourceless blue glow, so he walked over and looked in the next one, also scrutinizing the wall as he passed. “What,” said Professor Quirrell, “are you doing?” “Searching the room,” Harry said. “There could be a clue, or an inscrip- tion, or a key we’ll need later, or something—” “Are you serious, or are you deliberately trying to slow us down? An- swer in Parseltongue.” Harry looked back. “Wass sseriouss,” hissed Harry. “Would have done ssame if came by mysself.” Professor Quirrell briefly massaged his forehead. “I confess,” he said, “that your approach would serve you well in, say, exploring the tomb of Amon-Set, so I will not quite call you an idiot, but still. The false puzzle, the outer form of the challenge, is a game meant for first-years. We simply go down through the trapdoor.” Beneath the trapdoor was a gigantic plant, something like an enor- mous dieffenbachia with wide leaves emerging from the central stem like a spiral staircase, but darker-coloured than a normal dieffenbachia, with tendril-like vines emerging from the central stem and hanging down. The base spread out wide with bigger leaves and tendrils, as though promis- ing to cushion anyone’s fall. Beneath was another stone chamber like the first, with the same nooks like false arched windows, emitting the same grey-blue light. “The obvious thought is to fly down on the broomstick in my pouch, or toss something heavy to see if those tendrils are traps,” Harry said, peer- ing down. “But I’m guessing you’ll say that we just walk down the leaves.” They certainly looked like they were meant to be a spiral staircase. “After you,” said Professor Quirrell. Harry carefully put a foot down on a leaf and found that it indeed sup- ported his weight. Then Harry took a last look around the room before departing, to see if there was anything worth noticing. The enormous dead dog called enough attention to itself that it was hard to focus on anything else. “Professor Quirrell,” Harry said, omitting the phrase your approach to dealing with obstacles has certain drawbacks, “what if somebody looks in the door and sees that the Cerberus is dead?” “Then they have probably already noticed something wrong with Snape,” said Professor Quirrell. “But since you insist…” The Defence Professor walked over to the three-headed corpse and placed his wand against it. He began a Latin-sounding incantation that was accompanied by a sense of rising apprehension, the Boy-Who-Lived feeling the Dark Lord’s power as he always had. The last word spoken was “Inferius” and it was accompanied by a final surge of STOP, DON’T. And the three-headed dog rose to a stand, its six eyes dull and blank, turning to watch the door once more. Harry stared at the huge Inferius with a horrible sinking sensation in his stomach, the third-worst feeling he’d ever felt in his life. He knew then that he’d seen and sensed this procedure before, only without the spoken Latin. The centaur who’d confronted him in the Forbidden Forest was dead. The Defence Professor had hit it with a real Avada Kedavra, not a fake one. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry had thought that if he could just get Hermione back then he could return to the code of nobody dying, the ethic of Batman. Most people went through their whole lives without anyone getting killed on whatever adventures they had. And that was not to be. He hadn’t even noticed, the day he lost his last chance to win. Even if Hermione was resurrected, now, Harry wouldn’t have come through the whole mess without anyone getting killed. He hadn’t even learned the centaur’s name. Harry said nothing aloud. The Defence Professor would either con- firm the accusation in Parseltongue or lie in plain speech, and either way the Defence Professor would have more reason to suspect Harry’s next ac- tions. But Harry knew that—although he didn’t know how he would stop Professor Quirrell, although he didn’t dare any positive act of betrayal, maybe not even making the decision, until it was almost time to win— there would never be an amicable settlement between him and Lord Volde- mort, for those two different spirits could not exist in the same world. And it was as if that resolution, that knowledge of opposition, invoked a strength from what Harry had thought of as his dark side. Harry had stopped trying to call deliberately on his dark side after the day he’d killed the troll. But his dark side had never been something separate from him. It had been something remembered from Tom Riddle. Harry didn’t know how that had happened, but taking the assumption and running with it, whatever echoes of cognitive skill were in his dark side should be there for him to use. Not as a separate mode, as Harry had conceptualized at first, but just as neural patterns with a strong tendency to chain into one another since they had once formed part of a connected whole. This unfortunately did not change that Professor Quirrell had the same skills with far more life experience backing them up, and also had the gun. Harry turned, and set foot on the giant plant, and began to walk down the spiral staircase provided by the leaves. It had taken Harry too long this time, but he’d recovered himself to some degree, despite the grief still weighing him down like thick water. It wasn’t a cold steel rod in his spine, but it was something straight and solid nonetheless. He was going to play this through, see Hermione returned to life first, and then, some- how, stop Professor Quirrell. Or stop Professor Quirrell first and then get the Stone himself. There had to be something, some possibility, some opportunity that would present itself, some way to stop Voldemort and return Hermione to life… Harry continued his descent. Behind him, the three-headed dog waited, guarding the gate. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND SE V EN THE TRUTH, PART I V The spiralling leaves of the gigantic dieffenbachia felt like forest loam beneath Harry’s shoes, not as unyielding as concrete, but support- ing his weight. Harry kept a wary eye on the tendrils, but they remained passive. When Harry reached the bottom of the leafy spiral staircase, the ten- drils suddenly whipped out and grasped Harry’s arms and legs. After a brief struggle, Harry allowed himself to go limp. “Interesting,” said Professor Quirrell, as he floated down from above, not touching any of the plant’s leaves or tendrils. “I notice that you seem to have no trouble losing to a plant.” Harry looked more closely at the Defence Professor, seeing him now without the lens of panic. Professor Quirrell was upright and moving, fly- ing without apparent difficulty; the sense of doom about him was strong. But his eyes were still sunken in the skull, his arms thin and wasted. The sickness had not been a bluff, and the obvious hypothesis was that the De- fence Professor had recently killed another unicorn to temporarily regain some strength. And the Defence Professor was also speaking like the mask of Pro- fessor Quirrell, not like Lord Voldemort, which might not be a bad thing from Harry’s perspective. Harry didn’t know why—unless it was that the Defence Professor still needed him for something—but it certainly seemed to be in Harry’s own interests to play along. “You specifically let me walk into this trap, Professor,” Harry answered, just the way he’d have spoken to Professor Quirrell. Roles, masks, remind him of how it was between us… “On my own, I’d have used my broomstick.” “Perhaps. How would an ordinary first-year solve this challenge? If they had their wand, that is.” The plant was now reaching tendrils out to- ward Professor Quirrell, but Professor Quirrell was hovering just out of their reach. Harry had now remembered Professor Sprout talking about a Devil’s Snare plant, which the Herbology textbook had said liked cool, dark places like caves—though how that could be true of a leafy plant was any- one’s guess. “At a guess, I’d say this is a Devil’s Snare plant and it might retreat from light or heat. So maybe a first-year could use Lumos? Today I’d use Inflammare, but I didn’t learn that spell until May.” A twirl of the Defence Professor’s wand, and a pattern of sprays of liquid shot out from it, striking the plant near the bases of its tendrils, hitting with a quiet splat and then a quiet hissing. All the tendrils touch- ing Harry frantically shot back and began to beat at the growing wounds appearing on the plant’s skin, as if trying to remove the pain-stimulus; something about the plant gave the impression that it was screaming soundlessly. Professor Quirrell finished drifting downward. “Now it is afraid of light, heat, acid, and me.” Harry stepped off the final leaves onto the floor, after a careful glance at his robes and then the floor to make sure that none of the acid had splashed anywhere. Harry had begun to suspect that Professor Quirrell was trying to make some sort of point, but Harry did not know what that point might be. “I thought we were on a mission, Professor. I can’t stop you, but is it smart to spend this much time on messing with me?” “Oh, we have time,” said Professor Quirrell, sounding amused. “There would be a great uproar if we were discovered here, guarded by an Inferius. You did not act like you had heard of such an uproar at your Quidditch match, before you arrived in this time and spoke to Snape as you did.” A slight chill came over Harry, as he comprehended this. Anything he did to beat Professor Quirrell would have to not disrupt the school, or at least the Quidditch game, because it hadn’t disrupted the Quidditch game. Even if enough forces could be called in to subdue Lord Voldemort, it might not be easy to do it without Professor McGonagall or Professor Flitwick or anyone else at the Quidditch game noticing… Fighting a smart enemy was hard. And even so…even so it seemed to Harry that if he stood in Professor Quirrell’s shoes, he would not be having leisurely conversations and play- ing mind games. Professor Quirrell was gaining something by taking his time here. But what? Was there some other process that had to run to completion? “By the by, have you betrayed me yet?” said Professor Quirrell. “Have not betrayed you yet,” Harry hissed. The Defence Professor gestured pointedly with the gun he was now holding in his left hand, and Harry walked ahead to the great wooden door at the end of the room, and opened it. 1729 CH APTER 107 1730 THE TRUTH I V 1731 CH APTER 107 Half a second later, Harry slammed the door and leapt back. It took Harry several seconds to master his breathing, and master himself. From behind the door came continued loud bellows, and great slams as of a rock club pounding the floor. “I suppose,” Harry said in a voice grown cold as well, “that since Dum- bledore would hardly put a real mountain troll in there, the next challenge is an illusion of my worst memories. Like a Dementor, with the memory projected into the outside world. Very amusing, Professor.” Professor Quirrell advanced himself toward the door, and Harry stepped well aside. Besides the sense of doom that was now strong about the Professor, Harry’s dark side or just plain instinct was advising him not to get anywhere near that black-crimson fire hovering above Professor Quirrell’s shoulder. Professor Quirrell swung open the door, and looked in. “Hm,” Profes- sor Quirrell said. “Just the troll, as you say. Ah, well. I had hoped to learn something about you more interesting than that. What lies within is a Kokorhekkus, also known as the common boggart.” “A boggart? What does that—no, I suppose I know what it does.” “A boggart,” Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was again that of a Hogwarts Professor lecturing, “gravitates to dark enclosures that are rarely opened, such as a neglected cupboard in the attic. It seeks to be left alone, and it will manifest in whatever form it thinks will scare you away.” “Scare me away?” Harry said. “I killed the troll.” “You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggart seeks out the instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it would have selected something more believable. In any case, the standard counter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre.” Professor Quir- rell gestured, and the blackened fire leapt off his shoulder and poured through the doorway. From within the room there was a single squeak, and then nothing. They advanced into the boggart’s former room, Professor Quirrell go- ing first this time. With the seeming mountain troll gone, the room was just another huge chamber lit by sconces of cold blue light. Professor Quirrell’s gaze seemed distant, thoughtful. He crossed the room without waiting for Harry, and swung open the door on the opposite wall of his own accord. Harry followed after, and not closely. 1733 CH APTER 107 1734 THE TRUTH I V 1735 CH APTER 107 1736 THE TRUTH I V 1737 CH APTER 107 1738 THE TRUTH I V 1739 1741 CH APTER 108 1742 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1743 CH APTER 108 1744 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1745 CH APTER 108 1746 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1747 CH APTER 108 1748 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1749 CH APTER 108 1750 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1751 CH APTER 108 1752 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1753 CH APTER 108 1754 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1755 CH APTER 108 1756 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1757 CH APTER 108 1758 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1759 CH APTER 108 1760 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1761 CH APTER 108 1762 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1763 CH APTER 108 1764 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1765 CH APTER 108 1766 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1767 CH APTER 108 1768 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1769 CH APTER 108 1770 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1771 CH APTER 108 1772 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1773 CH APTER 108 1774 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1775 CH APTER 108 1776 THE TRUTH V: ANSW ERS AND RIDDLES 1777 CH APTER 108 1778 1779 CH APTER 10 9 1780 REFLECTIONS I 1781 CH APTER 10 9 1782 REFLECTIONS I 1783 CH APTER 10 9 1784 REFLECTIONS I 1785 CH APTER 10 9 1786 REFLECTIONS I 1787 CH APTER 10 9 1788 REFLECTIONS I Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor Quirrell’s orders, to sstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be sschoolmasster from sseeing you, as Professor Quirrell said in Parseltongue. “Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror your- self,” Professor Quirrell said. “If a gush of lava comes forth, you will also burn. I feel that much symmetry should apply.” Professor Quirrell pointed to a spot near the right of the door through which they’d entered the room, before the Mirror and well back of it. Harry, wearing the Cloak, went to where Professor Quirrell had pointed him, and did not argue. It was increasingly unclear to Harry whether both Riddles dying here would be a bad thing, even with hundreds of other student hostages at stake. For all of Harry’s good intentions, he’d mostly shown himself so far to be an idiot, and the returned Lord Voldemort was a threat to the entire world. (Though either way, Harry couldn’t see Dumbledore doing the lava thing. Dumbledore was probably sufficiently angry at Voldemort to dis- card his usual restraint, but lava wouldn’t permanently stop an entity that Dumbledore believed to be a discorporate soul.) Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering cir- cle appeared around where Harry was standing on the floor. This, Profes- sor Quirrell said, would soon become a Greater Circle of Concealment, by which nothing within that circle could be heard or seen from the outside. Harry would not be able to make himself apparent to the false Dumble- dore by taking off the Cloak, nor by shouting. “You will not cross this circle once it is active,” Professor Quirrell said. “That would cause you to touch my magic, and while Confunded I might not remember how to halt the resonance that would destroy us both. And further, since I do not want you throwing shoes—” Professor Quirrell made another gesture, and just within the Greater Circle of Conceal- ment, a slight shimmer appeared in the air, a globe-shaped distortion. “Thiss barrier will explode if touched, by you or other material thing. The resonance might lash at me afterwards, but you would also be dead. Now tell me in Parseltongue that you do not intend to cross this circle or take off your Cloak or do anything at all impulsive or stupid. Tell me you will wait quietly here, under the Cloak, until this is over.” This Harry repeated back. Then Professor Quirrell’s robes became black tinged with gold, such robes as Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and Professor Quirrell pointed his own wand at his head. Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still holding his wand to his head. His eyes were closed in concentration. And then Professor Quirrell said, “Confundus.” At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he blinked a few times as though confused, lowering his wand. A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had worn; without any visible change his eyes seemed older, the few lines in his face calling attention to themselves. His lips were set in a sad smile. Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, as though he had all the time in the world. He crossed into the Mirror’s range of reflection without anything hap- pening, and stared into the surface. What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to Harry it seemed that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the room behind it, like a portal to another place. “Ariana,” breathed the man. “Mother, father. And you, my brother, it is done.” The man stood still, as if listening. “Yes, done,” the man said. “Voldemort came before this mirror, and was trapped by Merlin’s method. He is only one more sealed horror now.” Again the listening stillness. “I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better this way.” The man bowed his head. “He is denied his death, forever; that vengeance is terrible enough.” Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was not what Dumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a strawman, a shallow stereotype…but then this wasn’t the real Aberforth’s spirit either, this was who Professor Quirrell imagined Dumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that doubly-reflected image of Aberforth wouldn’t notice anything amiss… “It is time to give back the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the man who thought he was Dumbledore. “It must go back into Master Flamel’s keep- ing, now.” Listening stillness. “No,” said the man, “Master Flamel has kept it safe these many years from all who would seek immortality, and I think it will be safest in his hands…no, Aberforth, I do think his intentions are good.” Harry couldn’t control the tension that was running through him like a live wire; he was having trouble breathing. Imperfect, Professor Quir- rell’s Confundus Charm had been imperfect. The underlying personality of Professor Quirrell was leaking through and seeing the obvious ques- tion: why was it okay for Nicholas Flamel himself to have the Stone if im- mortality was so awful? Even if Professor Quirrell imagined Dumbledore was blind to the question, he hadn’t included a clause in the Confundus saying that Dumbledore’s image of Aberforth wouldn’t think of it; and all of this was ultimately a reflection of Professor Quirrell’s own mind, an im- age from within the intelligence of Tom Riddle… “Destroy it?” said the man. “Maybe. I am not sure it can be destroyed, or Master Flamel would have done it long since. I think, many times, that he has regretted making it…Aberforth, I promised him, and we are not so ancient or so wise ourselves. The Philosopher’s Stone must go back into the keeping of the one who made it.” And Harry’s breath stopped. The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his left hand, the size perhaps of Harry’s thumb from fingernail to the first joint. The surface sheen of the scarlet glass made it seem wet; the appearance was of blood, suspended in time and made into a jagged surface. “Thank you, my brother,” the man said quietly. Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor Quirrell know what the true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror give back the real Stone under these conditions, or make an imitation and return that? And then— “No, Ariana,” the man said, smiling gently, “I fear I must go now. Be patient, my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you in truth…why? Why, I am not sure why I must go…when I hold the Stone I am to step aside from the Mirror and wait for Master Flamel to contact me, but I am not sure why I need to step aside from the Mirror to do that…” The man sighed. “Ah, I am getting old. It is well this dreadful war ended when it did. I suppose there is no harm if I speak to you for a time, my dearest, if you wish it so.” A headache was starting behind Harry’s eyes; some part of Harry was trying to send a message about not having breathed in a while, but no-one was listening. Imperfect, Professor Quirrell’s Confundus Charm had been imperfect, Professor Quirrell’s image of Dumbledore’s image of Ariana wanted to talk to Dumbledore, and maybe didn’t want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on some level that there wasn’t really an after- life, and the previously implanted impulse to leave after getting the Stone wasn’t standing up to Riddle-Ariana’s arguments… And then Harry felt himself become very calm. He started breathing again. Either way, there wasn’t much Harry could do about it. Professor Quirrell had stopped Harry from intervening; well, Professor Quirrell was welcome to reap the consequences of that decision. If the consequences caught Harry as well, so be it. The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding pa- tiently, sometimes replying to his dearest sister. Sometimes the man cast an uneasy look to one side; as if feeling a strong impulse to go, but sup- pressing that impulse with the great patience and politeness and concern for his sister that Professor Quirrell imagined Albus Dumbledore having. Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man’s ex- pression changed, becoming again the face of Professor Quirrell. And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing Harry the reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the real Albus Dumbledore, as though he were standing just behind the Mirror and vis- ible through it. The real Dumbledore’s face was set, and grim. “Hello, Tom,” said Albus Dumbledore. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND TEN REFLECTIONS, PART II The grimness on Albus Dumbledore’s face lasted only an instant be- fore giving way to bewilderment. “Quirinus? What—” And then there was a pause. “Well,” said Albus Dumbledore. “I do feel stupid.” “I should hope so,” Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had been at all shocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A casual wave of his hand changed his robes back to a Professor’s clothing. Dumbledore’s grimness had returned and redoubled. “There I am, searching so hard for Voldemort’s shade, never noticing that the Defence Professor of Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead victim possessed by a spirit far more powerful than himself. I would call it senility, if so many others had not missed it as well.” “Quite,” said Professor Quirrell. He lifted his eyebrows. “Really, am I that hard to recognise without the glowing red eyes?” “Oh, yes indeed,” Albus Dumbledore said in level tones. “Your acting was perfect; I confess myself utterly deceived. Quirinus Quirrell seemed— what is the term I am looking for? Ah yes, that is the word. He seemed sane.” Professor Quirrell chuckled; he looked for all the world as though the two of them were just having a casual conversation. “I never was insane, you know. Lord Voldemort was just another game for me, the same as Professor Quirrell.” Albus Dumbledore did not look like he was enjoying a casual chat. “I thought you might say that. I regret to inform you, Tom, that anyone who can bring himself to act the part of Voldemort is Voldemort.” “Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, raising an admonishing finger. “There is a loophole in that reasoning, old man. Anyone who acts the part of Volde- mort must be what moralists call ‘evil’, on this we agree. But perhaps the real me is completely, utterly, irredeemably evil in an interestingly differ- ent fashion from what I was pretending with Voldemort—” “I find,” Albus Dumbledore ground out, “that I do not care.” “Then you must think yourself to be rid of me very soon,” said Profes- sor Quirrell. “How interesting. My immortal existence must depend on discovering what trap you have set, and finding a way to escape from it, as soon as possible.” Professor Quirrell paused. “But let us pointlessly de- lay to talk of other matters first. How did you come to be waiting inside the Mirror? I thought you would be elsewhere.” “I am there,” Albus Dumbledore said, “and also inside the Mirror, un- fortunately for you. I have always been here, all along.” “Ah,” said Professor Quirrell, and sighed. “I suppose my little distrac- tion was for naught, then.” And the rage of Albus Dumbledore was no longer leashed. “Distrac- tion?” roared Dumbledore, his sapphire eyes tight with fury. “You killed Master Flamel for a distraction?” Professor Quirrell looked dismayed. “I am wounded by the injustice of your accusation. I did not kill the one you know as Flamel. I simply commanded another to do so.” “How could you? Even you, how could you? He was the library of all our lore! Secrets you have forever lost to wizardry!” There was an edge to Professor Quirrell’s smile, now. “You know, I still do not comprehend how your twisted mind can consider it acceptable for Flamel to be immortal, but when I seek the same it makes me a monster.” “Master Flamel never descended into immortality! He—” Dumbledore choked. “He only stayed awake past his evening, for our sakes, through his long, long day—” “I don’t know if you recall this,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice airy, “but do you recall that day in your office with Tom Riddle? The one where I begged you, where I went down on my knees and begged you, to intro- duce me to Nicholas Flamel so that I could ask to become his apprentice, to some day make for myself the Philosopher’s Stone? That was my last attempt to be a good person, if you are curious. You told me no, and gave me a lecture on how disgraceful it was to be afraid of death. I went from your office in bitterness and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be called evil in any case, just for not wanting to die, then I might as well be evil; and one month later I killed Abigail Myrtle to pursue immortality by other means. Even when I knew more of Flamel, I remained quite put out with your hypocrisy; and for that reason I tormented you and yours more than I otherwise would have done. I have often felt that you ought to know this, but we never had a chance to talk frankly.” “I decline,” said Albus Dumbledore, whose gaze did not waver. “I do not accept the tiniest shred of responsibility for what you have become. That was all, entirely, you and your own decisions.” “I am not surprised to hear you say that,” said Professor Quirrell. “Well, now I am curious as to what responsibilities you do accept. You have access to some unusual power of Divination; that much I deduced long ago. You made too many nonsensical moves, and the paths by which they worked out in your favour were too ridiculous. So tell me. Were you forewarned of the result, that night of All Hallow’s Eve when I was vanquished for a time?” “I knew,” said Albus Dumbledore, his voice low and cold. “For that, I accept responsibility, which is something you will never understand.” “You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he brought to me.” “I allowed it to happen,” said Albus Dumbledore. “And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own foreknowl- edge.” Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in sadness. “So the great hero Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting pawns, Lily and James Potter, merely to banish me for a few years.” Albus Dumbledore’s eyes were like stones. “James and Lily would have gone willingly to the death, if they had known.” “And the little baby?” Professor Quirrell said. “Somehow I doubt the Potters would have been so eager to leave him in the path of You-Know- Who.” You could scarcely see the flinch. “The Boy-Who-Lived came out of it well enough. Tried to turn him into you, did you? Instead you turned your- self into a corpse, and Harry Potter became the wizard you should have been.” Now there was something like the usual Dumbledore behind the half-moon glasses, a tiny twinkle in those eyes. “All of Tom Riddle’s icy brilliance, tamed to the service of James and Lily’s warmth and love. I won- der how you felt when you saw what Tom Riddle could have become, if he had grown up in a loving family?” Professor Quirrell’s lips twitched. “I was surprised, even shocked, by the abyssal depths of Mr Potter’s naivete.” “I suppose the humour of the situation would be lost on you.” It was then, finally, that Albus Dumbledore smiled. “How I laughed when I re- alised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to oppose the evil one—ah, how I laughed! I never had the steel for my role, but Harry Pot- ter shall be more than equal to it, when he comes into his power.” Albus Dumbledore’s smile disappeared. “Though I suppose Harry shall have to find some other Dark Lord to vanquish for it, since you will not be there.” “Ah, yes. That.” Professor Quirrell made to walk away from the Mirror, and seemed to halt just before reaching the point where the Mirror would no longer have reflected him, if it had been reflecting him. “Interesting.” Dumbledore’s smile was colder, now. “No, Tom. You are not going any- where.” Professor Quirrell nodded. “What have you done, exactly?” “You have refused death,” said Dumbledore, “and if I destroyed your body, your spirit would only wander back, like a dumb animal that cannot understand it is being sent away. So I am sending you outside Time, to a frozen instant from which neither I nor any other can return you. Perhaps Harry Potter will be able to retrieve you some day, if prophecy speaks true. He may wish to discuss with you just who is at fault for the deaths of his parents. For you it will only be an instant—if you ever return at all. Either way, Tom, I wish you the best of it.” “Hm,” said Professor Quirrell. The Defence Professor had paced past where Harry stood, watching mute and with something like horror, only to halt again at the other edge of the mirror. “As I suspected. You are using Merlin’s old method of sealing, what the tale of Topherius Chang names as the Process of the Timeless. If legend speaks true, not even you can stop the process, now that it has been in motion this long.” “Indeed,” said Albus Dumbledore. But his eyes were suddenly wary. And Harry, from where he stood just before and to the right of the door, waiting in silence and controlled terror, could feel it in the air; he could feel the sense of a presence gathering within the Mirror’s field. Some- thing more alien than magic, everything about it incomprehensible ex- cept for the fact of its strangeness and the fact of its power. It had been slow but now it was waxing faster, that presence. “But you could still reverse the effect, if Chang’s account is true,” said Professor Quirrell. “Most powers of the Mirror are double-sided, accord- ing to legend. So you could banish what is on the other side of the Mir- ror instead. Send yourself, instead of me, into that frozen instant. If you wanted to, that is.” “And why would I do that?” Albus Dumbledore’s voice was tight. “I sup- pose you are going to tell me that you have taken hostages? That was futile, Tom, you fool! You utter fool! You should have known that I would give you nothing for any hostages you had taken.” “You always were one step too slow,” said Professor Quirrell. “Allow me to introduce you to my hostage.” Another presence invaded the air around Harry, a crawling sensation all over his flesh as another Tom Riddle’s magic passed very close to his skin. The Cloak of Invisibility was torn away from him, and the shimmer- ing black Cloak flew away from him, through the air. Professor Quirrell caught it, and swiftly drew it over himself; in less than a second he had pulled down the Cloak’s hood over his head, and disappeared. Albus Dumbledore staggered, as though some essential support had been removed from him. “Harry Potter,” the Headmaster breathed. “What are you doing here?” Harry stared at the image of Albus Dumbledore, on whose face utter shock and utter dismay were warring. The guilt and the shame were too much, too much, hitting Harry all at once, and he could feel the incomprehensible presence around him rising to a peak. Harry knew without words that there was no time left, and that he was done. “It’s my fault,” Harry said in a tiny voice, from whatever part of him had taken over his throat in the final extremity. “I was stupid. I’ve always been stupid. You mustn’t rescue me. Goodbye.” “Why, look at that,” sang out Professor Quirrell’s voice from the empty air, “I don’t seem to have a reflection any more.” “No,” said Albus Dumbledore. “No, no, no!” Into the hand of Albus Dumbledore flew from his sleeve his long, dark- grey wand, and in his other hand, as though from nowhere, appeared a short rod of dark stone. Albus Dumbledore threw these both violently aside, just as the build- ing sense of power rose to an unbearable peak, and then disappeared. The Mirror returned to showing the ordinary reflection of a gold-lit room of white stone, without any trace of where Albus Dumbledore had been. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND ELE V EN FAILURE, PART I The Dark Lord was laughing. From the empty air came the voice of the Defence Professor laughing wildly, so high and terrible his laughter; it was Voldemort’s laughter now, the Dark Lord’s laughter beyond all hiding or restraint. Harry’s mind was disarrayed. His eyes kept staring at where Albus Dumbledore had been. There was a horror in him that was too huge for understanding or reflection. His mind kept trying to fall back through time and undo reality, but that wasn’t a sort of magic that existed, and reality stayed the same. He had lost, he had lost Dumbledore, there were no take-backs, and that meant he had lost the war. And the Dark Lord went on laughing. “Ah, ah hah, ah hah hah ha! Professor Dumbledore, ah, Professor Dumbledore, such a fitting end to our game!” Another burst of wild laughter. “The wrong sacrifice even at the finish, for the piece you gave up everything to save was already in my possession! The wrong trap even from the beginning, for I could have abandoned this body at any time! Ah, hahahahaha, aha! You never did learn cunning, you poor old fool.” “You—” A voice was coming from Harry’s throat. “You—” “Ahahahaha! Why, yes, little child, you were always along on this ad- venture as my hostage, it was your whole purpose in being here. Ha, ha- hahaha! You are decades too young to play this game against the real Tom Riddle, child.” The Dark Lord drew back the hood of the Cloak, his head becoming visible, and began to remove the rest of the Cloak. “And now, boy, you have helped me, yess indeed, and sso it iss time to ressurrect your girl-child friend. To keep promisse.” The Dark Lord’s smile was cold, cold indeed. “I sup- pose you have doubts? Mark well, I could kill you this instant, for there is no longer a Headmaster of Hogwarts to be informed of it. Doubt me all you wish, but remember that.” The hand was once more holding the gun. “Now come along, foolish child.” And they left. They went back out through the door into the Potions room, the Dark Lord banishing the returned purple fire with a stroke of his wand. They went through the chamber where the boggart had been, and the chamber of ruined chess statues, and through the burned door of the chamber of keys. The Dark Lord floated up through the trapdoor, and Harry strug- gled up afterwards through the spiral staircase of leaves, the tendrils of the Devil’s Snare twitching and then moving back as though afraid. The Boy-Who-Lived was trying hard not to burst into tears, and his dark-side patterns weren’t helping, maybe because Voldemort had never known or dealt with guilt. They passed the huge three-headed Inferi, and at a whispered word from the Dark Lord it collapsed over the trapdoor and became a corpse again. They passed Severus Snape standing guard, who told them both that he was guarding the door, and that they must leave or he would deduct House points. The Dark Lord spoke the words “Hyakuju montauk” without pausing in his stride, accompanied by a jab of his wand; and Severus staggered before he lifelessly drew himself up beside the door once more. “What—” Harry said, as he followed. “What did you—” “Just fulfilling my obligation to my faithful servant. It shall not kill him, as I promised you.” The Dark Lord laughed again. “The hostages—” Harry said. It was hard to keep his voice steady. “The students, you said you’d stop whatever is going to kill them—” “Yess. Stop worrying. Will do on our way out.” “Out?” “We are leaving, child.” The Dark Lord was still smiling. The bad feeling this raised was lost in a sea of other bad feelings. The Dark Lord was now consulting what he’d called the Hogwarts Map, the handwritten lines upon it seeming to move as they walked. Some part of Harry’s mind that had been considering what to do if they ran into Au- rors on patrol (whom the Dark Lord could kill, or Obliviate, in an instant) gave up that hope as well. They went down the Grand Staircase to the second floor, encountering no-one. The Dark Lord made a turn Harry did not know, and went down an- other stair-flight. As they descended past one floor and another, the win- dows stopped and the torches began, they were within the Slytherin dun- geons now. Ahead, the form of a person in Hogwarts robes appeared. The Dark Lord kept walking toward that person. Harry followed. A sixth- or seventh-year Slytherin was waiting by a section of wall that was set with an artistic carving of Salazar Slytherin wielding his wand, against what looked like a giant covered in icicles. The witch made no com- ment at seeing Professor Quirrell walking upright, or seeing Harry in his company, or seeing the gun in the Defence Professor’s hand. If her eyes were blank, Harry couldn’t tell the difference. The Dark Lord reached into his robes, took out a Knut, and flipped it to her. “Klaudia Alicja Tabor, I command you thus. Take this Knut to the spell circle I showed you beneath the Quidditch stands and put it in the centre. Then Obliviate yourself of the last six hours.” “Yes, lord,” the witch said, bowing to him, and went on her way. “I thought—” Harry said. “I thought you needed the Stone to—” The Dark Lord was still smiling, he had never stopped smiling. “I did not say that part in Parseltongue, child. All I said in Parseltongue was that I had set events in motion to kill students, events that I would stop if I ob- tained the Stone. The rest was in human speech. I would also have stopped the Blood Fort sacrifice if I had not obtained the Stone, so long as I was not discovered and restrained. The students of Hogwarts are a valuable resource, whom I have already spent much time training.” Then the Dark Lord hissed to the wall, “Open.” Harry’s eyes saw the tiny snake that had been set in the upper-left of the carving, even as the wall slowly swung backward, revealing the open- ing of a huge pipe. Moss grew on its sides and a musty dusty smell welled up from it; the interior was also covered with cobwebs in multiple sheets. “Spiders…” murmured the Dark Lord. He sighed, and for that brief moment he sounded once more like Professor Quirrell. The Dark Lord walked into the huge pipe, the cobwebs burning away before him. Harry, not seeing any other better options, followed. The pipe branched in a Y-shape, then branched again. The Dark Lord went left, then right. The pipe came to a solid metal wall. “Open,” the Dark Lord hissed, and a crack appeared in the metal; it seemed to fold into itself. Beyond was the middle of a long, stone tunnel. “We shall be walking a while,” said the Dark Lord. “Did you have more questions to ask, little child?” “I—I can’t think of any—right now—” Another cold laugh replied to this, and they walked into the tunnel, turning right. Harry didn’t know, then or ever, how long he walked; the light of burn- ing spiderwebs was too dim to read his mechanical watch, and Harry had not thought to look at the time before entering. It felt like they walked for miles, miles beneath the ground. Slowly, Harry’s mind tried to recover itself a final time. Very pos- sibly final, if he was right about the Dark Lord killing him after this… though the Dark Lord had said that he would resurrect Hermione, which seemed pointless if that was true…was that simply the Dark Lord follow- ing through on a promise he would not otherwise have been able to make in Parseltongue…why had he not just shot Harry on the spot… Seriously, some last functioning part of his brain said to all the other parts, this would be a good time to think of something, something that the Dark Lord has not already thought of, something we can do without our pouch or our wand or our Time-Turner, something that Professor Quirrell has not imagined we can do…think, think, pretty pretty please think of something? Don’t shut down now, even if you’re scared, even if we’ve never really really faced death before in the sense of being about to die in the next hour, this is not the time to shut down— Harry’s mind stayed blank. Suppose, said that last remaining part, suppose we try to condition on the fact that we win this, or at least get out of this alive. If someone told you as a fact that you had survived, or even won, somehow made everything turn out okay, what would you think had happened— Not legitimate procedure, whispered Ravenclaw, the universe doesn’t work like that, we’re just going to die. Someone realises we’re missing, thought Hufflepuff, and Mad-Eye Moody shows up with a squad of Aurors and rescues us. I think the time has come to admit we’re not more competent than the standard authorities. The saving factor does have to be something we do somehow, said the last voice. Otherwise there’s no point in our thinking about it. Problem two, said Gryffindor. Harry Potter isn’t missing, he’s right there at the Quidditch match where everyone can see him. Professor Quirrell thought of that too, it’s part of why he sent that fake note. Problem three. I don’t think Mad-Eye Moody and an Auror squad can beat the Dark Lord, and certainly not before he kills us. I’m not sure the entire DMLE can beat the Dark Lord if he’s fighting seriously and Dumbledore is gone. Problem four. The Quidditch match was not disrupted, that’s probably the only reason why Professor Quirrell was willing to try something as complicated as bringing us along on this trip in the first place. Thinking along different lines, ventured Slytherin, maybe Professor Quirrell calls in someone else to Memory-Charm us. Legilimency, Imperius, Confundus, who knows what else, we’re not a perfect Occlumens. Then the Dark Lord would have a smart—well, sort of smart lieutenant that he could use. That could be an- other reason why Professor Quirrell was so willing to tell us secrets, if he knew that the memory would disappear. It’s also a reason to leave the Hogwarts wards, so the Dark Lord can call Bellatrix to Apparate in and do the work… This entire reasoning process is illegitimate and I refuse to participate, said Ravenclaw. What lovely last words, said the last voice. Now shut up and think. Rough stone tunnel went by underfoot, Harry’s shoes sometimes dip- ping into moisture or nearly slipping on a curved surface. The neurons in his brain, which kept on firing, imagined voices talking to each other, yelling at each other, even as the Listener stayed numb with horror and shame. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff were conducting a debate about suicide by charging the Dark Lord’s gun, or by swallowing the little jewel on Harry’s steel ring. It seemed unclear whether the fate of the world was better or worse if the Dark Lord had Harry as a mind-slave; if the Dark Lord was going to win anyway, it might be better if he won faster. And the last voice kept talking through it all; even in the depths of fail- ure that last voice remained. What else did the Dark Lord always say in human speech and never in Parseltongue? Do we remember? Anything like that, anything at all? It was all too distant in time, too distant in time even though it had all happened this very day. The Dark Lord had told him in Parseltongue just now that it was time to revive Hermione, and then he’d said other things all in English, Harry could hardly remember for all that they’d just been spoken. Before then…before then there’d been the Circle of Conceal- ment, when Professor Quirrell had hissed that the barrier would explode if touched. And the Defence Professor had said in English for Harry not to take off his Cloak or try crossing the Circle, said in English that the resonance might strike Professor Quirrell afterwards but Harry would be dead. Said in English that if Harry touched the magic and Professor Quir- rell didn’t remember how to halt the resonance, it would kill them both… Suppose it doesn’t kill us both, said the last voice. On Halloween in Godric’s Hollow, the Dark Lord’s body was burned and we only ended up with a scar on our forehead. Suppose the resonance between us is deadlier to the Dark Lord than to us. What if this entire time we’ve been able to kill the Dark Lord at any time, just by dashing forward and touching our hands to any part of his exposed skin? And then it makes our scar bleed again, but that’s all. The sense of ‘stop, don’t do that’ is inherited from the Dark Lord’s worst memory of his mistake in Godric’s Hollow, it may not actually apply to the Boy-Who-Lived. A small note of hope rose. Rose, and was quashed. The Dark Lord can just throw away his wand, droned Ravenclaw. Professor Quirrell can turn into his Animagus form. Even if he dies the Dark Lord will possess someone else and return, and then torture our parents, to punish us. We might be able to get to our parents in time, said the last voice. We might be able to hide them. We might be able to get the Philosopher’s Stone away from the Dark Lord if we killed his current body now, and that Stone could provide the nucleus of a counter-army. The Dark Lord was moving on through the stony corridor. His hand still held the gun. He was at least four metres away from Harry. If we dart forward, he will sense us approaching through the resonance, said Hufflepuff. He will fly forward rapidly, he can do that, he has the broomstick en- chantments that let him fly. He will fly forward, turn around, and fire the gun. He knows about the resonance, he’s thought of this already. This is not something the Dark Lord has failed to consider. He will be ready for it, and waiting. Continuing the same line of argument, said the last voice. Suppose we can freely cast magic on Professor Quirrell but he can’t cast it on us. Why would that be true? demanded Ravenclaw. In fact, we have evidence that it’s false. In Azkaban, when Professor Quirrell’s Avada Kedavra hit our Pa- tronus Charm, it felt like our head was splitting apart— Suppose that was all his magic going out of control. Suppose if we’d just cast, say, a Luminos targeting him, nothing bad would have happened. But why? said Ravenclaw. Why suppose that? Because, thought Harry, it explains why Professor Quirrell didn’t warn me not to cast any magic on him in Azkaban. Because Professor Quirrell never said in Parseltongue, that I can remember, that I’d hurt myself if I tried to cast magic on him. He could have given me that warning, but he didn’t, even though he gave me a lot of other warnings. Absence of evidence is weak evidence of absence. There was a pause while Harry’s parts considered this. We don’t actually have our wand, said Ravenclaw. We might get it back at some point, thought the last voice. But even then, Harry thought, and the grey hopelessness returned, the resonance is something the Dark Lord knows about. He’s already thought of every- thing I can do with that, he already has a response prepared. That was my mistake from the beginning. I didn’t respect the Dark Lord’s intelligence, I didn’t think that maybe he knew everything I knew and could see everything I saw and had already taken it into account. Then, said the last voice, conditional on our winning, we must have hit him with something he doesn’t know about. Dementors, offered Gryffindor. The Dark Lord knows we can destroy, deflect, and possibly control Dementors, said Ravenclaw. He doesn’t know how, but he knows we have the capability, and where the heck would we get a Dementor anyway? Maybe, ventured Hufflepuff, the Dark Lord’s whole horcrux system would short out via the resonance if we grabbed him and held him, sacrificing our own life to destroy him forever. Balderdash, said Ravenclaw. But I guess it doesn’t hurt to engage in some pleasant fantasy before we die, no matter how stupid. If Lord Voldemort had a strong enough fear of death, Hufflepuff argued, if he wanted strongly enough to just not need to think about death again, then the horcrux system could have design flaws like that. It never occurred to Voldemort to test his horcruxes on someone else, that could indicate he wasn’t able to think about the subject clearly— So his fear of death is his fatal weakness? said Ravenclaw. Yeah, no. I’m think- ing someone with over a hundred horcruxes might have a few fail-safe mechanisms in there. And Harry’s brain went on thinking. A genuine asymmetry in the magical resonance between them… seemed improbable, there was no reason for the magical effect to work like that. But the magical backlash could hit the stronger wizard harder, the more powerful magic resonating more dangerously. That could ex- plain the observed event in Godric’s Hollow (Voldemort explodes, baby survives), and also explain the observed event in Azkaban (Voldemort severely impaired by backlash of his strong magic, first-year Boy-Who- Lived hit by lighter backlash of his weak magic). Or if it was only the caster’s magic that resonated, that could also explain both those two observations. That might even explain why Professor Quirrell had been in no rush to warn Harry against casting any magic on him. Though there was another obvious reason why Professor Quirrell would avoid raising the subject of the resonance; it was a gigantic hint about the mystery of Godric’s Hollow, if Harry had ever made the connection. The part that was numb with grief and guilt took this opportunity to observe, speaking of obliviousness, that after events at Hogwarts had turned serious, they really really really REALLY should have reconsidered the decision made on First Thursday, at the behest of Professor McGon- agall, not to tell Dumbledore about the sense of doom that Harry got around Professor Quirrell. It was true that Harry hadn’t been sure who to trust, there was a long stretch where it had seemed plausible that Dumbledore was the bad guy and Professor Quirrell the heroic opposition, but… Dumbledore would have realised. Dumbledore would have realised instantly. The wise old wizard with the true phœnix on his shoulder would have known, and Harry hadn’t trusted him, Harry hadn’t told him all the rel- evant facts, and the reason for this had been sheer neglect to reconsider a cached decision made four days into the start of the school year. It had been marked ‘something not to tell Dumbledore’ and even after Azkaban, even after Hermione died, even after everything, Harry had simply forgot to promote the question to deliberation and reconsider the trade-off. Another wave of grief and shame washed over Harry, and for a time he walked on in the silence of the last voice, other voices being happy enough to fill the gap. After what was at least several miles, and many grey thoughts, the stone tunnel ended. The Dark Lord climbed up stone steps, and Harry followed after. The two of them came into a dark, dank stone building. Dirty old stone doors swung open without being touched. Before them lay marble slabs, rising up from bare ground, upon them names and dates. The tombstones were scattered in nothing like neat rows, and the rest of the graveyard ran wild. The moon above was over three-quarters full, already seeming bright with night not fully fallen. Harry had stopped walking upon seeing the graveyard. There was a blaring alarm in his brain saying to be anywhere other than here, but there weren’t any options for accomplishing that. So that alarm cried unan- swered, even as behind Harry the stone doors of the mausoleum swung shut again and sealed themselves. The Dark Lord came into the centre of the scattered graveyard. He stopped walking, and waved his wand above his head in a small circle. There was a rumbling sound, and smoothly from the ground rose an altar, at least two metres wide and of black stone carved with grey sig- ils. And then surrounding the altar groaned up six dark-marble obelisks, regularly spaced, gleaming darkly beneath the fading twilight sky. The unanswerable alarm in Harry’s brain grew louder. “This,” said the Dark Lord in Professor Quirrell’s cadences, “is a workspace I made for myself, convenient to either Hogwarts or Hogsmeade.” The Dark Lord flourished a hand at the altar. “That is where Miss Granger shall revive, and also where I shall be reborn into my true body. I shall re- make myself first, of course. Magicss to revive girl-child eassier with true body.” A strange snakish laughter accompanied these words. “Resst asssured that though ssome asspectss of girl-child'ss ressurrection sshall be what otherss conssider Dark, girl-child will not be harmed or made ugly by it. Shall sstill look like hersself, mind sshall be her own, nor sshall I or mine harm her after.” Harry’s tongue was dry and his mind was having trouble functioning. “Please, Professor, would you say in Parseltongue what is your real pur- pose in resurrecting Miss Granger?” “To resstore to you girl-child friend'ss counssel and resstraint. To make ssure sshe iss part of the world for you to care about. That, boy, iss truly the greater part of the reasson I am doing thiss deed.” Again snakish laughter accompanied these words, conveying sardonic awareness of some vast irony. A small spark of hope kindled inside Harry, alongside the much greater note of confusion, and the fear that a perfect Occlumens could indeed lie in Parseltongue. Harry didn’t understand why the Dark Lord was doing this, if the next step was just to kill the Boy-Who-Lived or enslave him… Maybe he’d just never understood Professor Quirrell at all, maybe somehow Harry’s model of Tom Riddle was just that wrong…maybe the Boy-Who-Lived would be Obliviated of the last day and dropped off some- where with a confused Hermione Granger, while Lord Voldemort went on to conquer the world…? Hope flared up in Harry, but it was a confused hope that didn’t make any sense. It didn’t square with the Dark Lord who had mocked Dumble- dore and laughed at his defeat. Harry couldn’t come up with any consis- tent account of Professor Quirrell’s motives that allowed for something like that. I do not know what is meant to happen next. The Dark Lord had moved forward to the altar. He knelt there, and seemed to reach deep into the stone of the altar itself, drawing forth a vial of liquid that looked black in the fading twilight. When the Dark Lord spoke again his voice was clipped and precise. “Blood, blood, blood so wisely hidden,” said the Dark Lord. And the obelisks surrounding the altar began to speak, voices like a chanting chorus coming from the motionless stones, cadences older than Latin. Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi. Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi. The obelisks’ chant echoed after the end of each line, as if they were speaking out of synchrony with each other. The blood was poured from the vial, and it seemed to catch and hang over the altar, slowly expanding through the air, taking on a shape. Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi (emoi). Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi (emoi). A tall form rested upon the altar, and even in the dimming twilight it looked too pale. The Defence Professor reached his hand into his robe, and drew forth a small irregular chunk of red glass. He placed that upon the tall pale body. The Stone stayed there for a time, minutes at least. The irregular chunk of red glass did not glow, or flash, or give any other indication of power. Then the Stone moved, just a little, turning slightly upon the body. The Defence Professor took back the Stone into his robes, and prodded the tall form that lay motionless upon the altar, touching the eyes with his fingers, poking the chest with his wand. He threw back his head, then, and laughed. “Incredible,” said the Dark Lord, in the voice of the Defence Profes- sor that Harry had known. “Fixed, it is fixed in form! A mere construct sustained by magic, become the true substance at the Stone’s touch! And yet I sensed nothing! Nothing! I feared I had been deceived, that I had obtained a false Stone, but the substance proves true to my every test!” The Defence Professor tucked the red glass back into his robes. “That is eldritch even by my standards, I admit.” Then the Defence Professor walked around the altar, five times he walked around it, chanting something too low for Harry to hear. The Dark Lord placed his wand in the hand of the figure lying on the altar. He placed his hands, both of them, over the body’s forehead. The Dark Lord spoke. “Fal. Tor. Pan.” Without any warning there was a flash like lightning that lit up the entire graveyard, and Harry staggered back a step, his hands involuntarily going to his forehead. It felt as if he had been shot there, or a wasp stung him, upon his scar. The Defence Professor collapsed. And the too-tall figure sat up upon the altar. It swung around smoothly, and stood tall upon the ground, at least a head higher than a normal man. The form’s limbs were lean and pale, little-muscled but giving an impression of terrible strength. Harry took another staggering step back, his hands still clasped to his scar. Though the distance between them was wide, Harry felt a sense of terrifying apprehension in the air, as though the sense of doom had al- ways been out of focus and had now clarified, concentrated into a physical pain in the scar on Harry’s forehead. Was that what Voldemort was supposed to look like? The nose looked like, it looked like it had malfunctioned during the resurrection process— The too-tall figure threw back his head and laughed, raising his hands and wand to look at them. The left hand opened wide and it was like a pale half-spider with four over-long legs, fingers caressing the wand held in the other hand. Leaves stirred up from the graveyard, approaching to dance around the too-tall figure, surrounding him and clothing him, re- forming into a high-necked shirt and flowing robes; and Lord Voldemort was laughing. Exactly the mirthless laughter that Harry remembered coming from his own throat inside the Dementor’s nightmare, precise in tone and timbre. Red eyes gleamed beneath the fading twilight, their pupils slitted like a cat’s. The form that Voldemort had abandoned raised itself, quivering, from the ground; and in a voice that Harry could barely hear, Quirinus Quirrell gasped, “Free—oh, free—” “Stupefy,” said the high cold voice of Voldemort, and Quirinus Quirrell was blasted down into the ground; then, with a wave of Voldemort’s other hand, Quirinus Quirrell was picked up and flung away from the altar. Voldemort walked away from the altar, then turned and looked at Harry; and the pain in Harry’s scar flared at it. “Frightened, child?” Voldemort hissed, like there was an undercurrent of Parseltongue even to the Dark Lord’s human speech. “Good. Place the girl on the altar, and break your Transfiguration. Iss time for me to revive her.” Is this really going to happen? Are we really going to do this? Harry swallowed, mastering his fear through that note of impossible hope amid the confusion, and walked over to the altar. Then Harry took off his left shoe, and his left sock, and took off the toe-ring that was Her- mione Granger, the Transfigured shape identical to the toe-ring that had been given Harry as an emergency portkey. There was a twinge of regret in Harry for not having the real portkey now, but only a twinge; an inner- circle Death Eater would routinely put up boundaries against portkeys, if Severus had been right. Behind Harry, Voldemort laughed again in what sounded like surprised appreciation. “I need my wand to Finite her,” Harry said aloud. “You do not.” High the voice and cruel. “You learned to sustain a Trans- figuration by touch alone, without further use of the wand. You can like- wise break your own Transfiguration wandlessly, by commanding your sustaining magic to drain away. Do so now.” Harry swallowed, and touched the toe-ring. He had to try three times, and clear his mind, before he could push his magic out of the toe-ring, as before he had learned to make a tiny stream of magic flow in. The breaking of the spell went much more slowly that way than a Fi- nite Incantatem, almost like the sped-up reverse of watching something being Transfigured. The toe-ring distorted, flowing together, expanding. Colours changed, textures changed. Two-thirds of a dead girl lay strewn across the altar, on her side with one arm falling off the altar’s edge, the position in which the reversion had chanced to place her. No blood flowed now from the chewed stumps of her thighs. The dead girl wore Hermione Granger’s face, but twisted and pale. It was as Harry had seen before in the hospital’s back room, the image burned into his brain during thirty long minutes of Transfiguration, the image he had reproduced during four even longer hours to Transfigure the decoy. The dead girl was naked, for her clothes were not part of her, and had not been Transfigured. The sight brought back flashbacks, of the hours spent in the infirmary room, of the nightmares afterwards, all of which Harry suppressed. “Go back,” said Voldemort’s high voice. “This is my work, now.” Harry swallowed, and retreated from the altar, to the mouth of the long corridor where he’d stood before. “Her body is, should be, around five Celsius, I cooled her so, so there wouldn’t be brain damage—” Harry’s own voice was wavering in pitch. Is he really going to do this? Really? There had to be a catch and Harry just couldn’t see it. Voldemort had said that neither he nor any of his would harm Hermione, that her body and mind would be her own—why? Voldemort walked forth to the altar once more, orienting the body be- fore him with a wave of his hand to lie straight across the altar. The Dark Lord spoke with high monotone precision, “Flesh, flesh, flesh so wisely hidden.” The obelisks began chanting once more. Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi (emoi). Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi (emoi). New flesh flowed out of the stumps of the girl’s thighs, creeping for- ward like an ooze and solidifying. The obelisks ceased chanting. A complete form lay naked upon the al- tar. It didn’t look like Hermione. A Hermione Granger should be standing up and talking, she should have her Hogwarts uniform. Voldemort raised a hand, then hissed, as though in annoyance. With a violent gesture, the robes around Quirinus Quirrell’s sleeping from were torn in half, his purple-and-green tie shredded, and his suit jacket drawn from him to where Voldemort stood. Some part of Harry flinched, as if seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort attacking Professor Quirrell. Voldemort plunged his hand deliberately into the suit jacket, which jerked as though something were being broken; then Voldemort shook out the suit jacket onto the ground beside him, emptying out the contents. Harry’s pouch fell from it, and his Time-Turner, and a broomstick, and Voldemort’s gun, and the Cloak, and a number of amulets and rings and stranger devices that Harry did not recognize. And finally a chunk of red glass, which was laid upon Hermione Gran- ger’s form, and allowed to stay there for a time. Minutes passed. The Dark Lord donned an amulet from the heap of things beside the altar; also from the heap, Voldemort took four short wooden rods with straps upon them, and reached beneath his robes to attach them, it looked like they went on his upper arms and upper thighs. The Dark Lord rose into the air, moved left, right, up and down, seeming to wobble slightly at first; then his flight stabilized. The chunk of red glass turned, slightly. The Dark Lord Voldemort floated to the ground, and prodded Hermi- one Granger’s body with his wand. “There iss an obsstacle,” hissed Voldemort. In Harry’s mind the expectation of betrayal or other failure had al- ready been so strong that the confirmation came only as a dull shock, not a sharp one. “What obsstacle?” “Girl'ss body iss resstored. Subsstance iss repaired. But not magic, or life…thiss iss body of dead Muggle.” Voldemort turned from the altar, began to pace. “The full ritual would solve this. But that would require time…time and the blood of Granger’s enemy, and I do not think Draco Malfoy still quali- fies, nor can I take my own blood unwillingly…foolish.” Voldemort’s voice was a lower hiss. “Foolish, I should have foreseen this, and prepared. Her brain might awaken with an electrical shock, I know that much of Muggle medicine…but would her magic return to her? That I do not know, and I suspect if she awakens as a Muggle she will be a Muggle forever. Still, I can think of nothing better.” The Dark Lord raised his wand— “Wait!” Harry blurted, feeling hope return. She needs a spark of life and magic, just a spark to get her started… Voldemort turned and looked at him. The snakelike face showed some slight degree of surprise. “Think I have ssomething that might work,” Harry hissed. “Needss wand. Have no intentionss to usse it againsst you.” Harry said nothing about expect- ing his intentions wouldn’t change; he’d simply blurted out the idea fast enough that he hadn’t formed any specific intentions yet. “Thiss,” Voldemort hissed, “I dessire to ssee.” The Dark Lord reached into the heap of things by the altar, and picked up the wrapped form of Harry’s wand. It was thrown, gliding through the air and then dropping at Harry’s feet; and then the Dark Lord floated back, the heap of things moving smoothly backwards with him. Harry unwrapped his wand, and moved forward. We have our wand back, that’s step one, said the last voice, the voice of hope. No part of Harry had any idea what step two might be, but it was still step one accomplished. And Harry stood before the reformed body of Hermione Granger, who was still naked and dead, on a twilight-lit stone altar. “Lord Voldemort,” Harry said, “I beg you, please give her some clothes. It might help me do this.” “Granted,” hissed Voldemort. The pain in Harry’s scar flared as the naked girl’s body lifted into the air, then flared again as dead leaves danced around her and she was clothed in the seeming of a Hogwarts uniform, though the trim was red instead of blue. Hermione Granger’s hands folded over her chest, her legs straightened, and her body drifted back down. Harry looked at her. Focused on her, now that she looked human again. She looks like she is sleeping, not dead. It took a conscious effort to look for breathing, fail to see it, and make the deduction. So far as naked per- ception was concerned…Hermione might as well be alive, right now. That Hermione Granger would not approve of this situation, taken as a whole, seemed beyond question. But it didn’t mean that she would rather stay dead than be alive, other things being equal, though they might not be. Because you wish to live, because my best guess is that you would wish to live… Harry reached out his shaking left hand, and touched Hermione’s forehead. It was warm now, not the chill of five degrees Celsius; either Voldemort had increased her body temperature to normal, or the magic of the ritual had done it automatically. Which meant that Hermione’s brain was currently warm and without oxygen, come to think. That did it, the sense of urgency rising in him. Harry’s feet assumed the stance, his wand swung up to point at Her- mione Granger’s dead body. The only thing wrong with Hermione’s body was that it was dead; everything else about that body was right, only one thing needed changing. You don’t belong here, death. “Expecto,” Harry shouted, feeling the magic and the life rise up into the Patronus Charm that was fuelled by both, “Patronum!” The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing aura of silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her. Harry staggered, as he felt a dip, a bite. Intuition or Tom Riddle’s mem- ory told Harry that the life and magic that had just flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It hadn’t been all his life or all his magic, not by a long shot, there hadn’t been time to expend that much, but whatever he’d just expended was gone forever. And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping, rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmed further, and Harry could not see if colour was returning to her, but it should have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to be sleeping peacefully, and it wasn’t because being dead looked like sleeping, it was because she was asleep and her body was fine and nothing was hurting her while she slept. Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up ear- lier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard, the recently victorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the situation, and that his guess about Hermione wanting to be alive was just a guess. Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The celebra- tory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained, Harry wasn’t screaming and running around in little circles like Professor Flitwick, but that— That— That, Harry said aloud inside his mind, That is what I call Step Two. “Interesting,” said the cold high voice. “Your Patronus draws upon your life as well as your magic…I guessed that much, for it was too power- ful for a first-year to fuel with magic alone. And yet there must be more to the puzzle, since not just any life-fuelled spell would have done…was your happy thought the image of her returning to life? Was that all it took?” Lord Voldemort was again toying with his wand, a dark interest in those red-slitted eyes. “I suspect I will feel quite stupid when I finally comprehend that spell, some day in my eternity. Now step away from the girl. There iss more work I intend to do, to give her besst chance of continued life.” Harry stepped back, reluctantly, the sense of tension starting to re- turn to him. He almost tripped over one haphazard grave marker, as the Dark Lord continued to walk forward. Standing before the altar, the Dark Lord laid one finger upon Hermi- one Granger’s forehead. Then the Dark Lord tapped his finger upon Hermione Granger’s fore- head, and said, in a voice so low Harry almost did not hear, “Requiescus.” Voldemort waved his hand at an obelisk, which began to rotate, turn- ing itself to lay flat upon the ground, pointing outward. “Fascinating in- deed,” Voldemort hissed. “She is alive, and magical, and not another Tom Riddle as I feared you might have made her.” The tension was rising again in Harry. He’d put his wand away into the back belt of his trousers, he did not want to remind Voldemort that he still had the wand on him. “What are you doing to her now?” Another obelisk turned, lay flat upon the ground. “There iss old, losst rit- ual to ssacrifice magical creature, transsfer magical nature to ssubject. Limitationss are great. Transsfer iss temporary, only few hourss. Subject ssometimess diess when transsfer wearss off. But Stone will make permanent.” Four obelisks lay flat upon the ground, evenly spaced; the other two obelisks had been floated away. Voldemort began to reach into his own mouth, checked himself, hissed with annoyance again. He gestured at the sleeping mouth of Quir- inus Quirrell, and from Quirrell’s mouth floated up two teeth, almost invisible in the falling night. One of these went to the pile of items, the other floated to before the altar. Moments later, Harry cried out and took a step back. Huge and misshapen, lumpy skin, legs thick as tree trunks, a small head that looked like a coconut perched upon a boulder. A mountain troll stood within the circle of obelisks, motionless as though asleep while standing. “What are you doing?” Voldemort’s mouth was stretched in a wide smile; it looked horrible on him, like his face had too many teeth. “Shall ssacrifice my fallback weapon, and girl-child sshall gain troll'ss power of regeneration. Transsfiguration ssicknesss iss nothing before that, if perchance it wass not fixed by previouss ritual. And no knife sshall sslay girl-child, nor cutting cursse, nor ssicknesss take her.” “Why—why are you doing this?” Harry’s voice shook. “Have not the tiniesst intention of letting girl-child die again, after going to ssuch lengthss to ressurrect her.” Harry swallowed. “I’m very confused.” Was Voldemort practising being nice? This hypothesis did not seem like a sufficient explanation. “Stay well back,” Voldemort said coldly. “This ritual is Darker than the last.” The Dark Lord began a new chant, softer syllables that seemed to seethe through the air like living things; and Harry, feeling a new surge of apprehension, stepped backwards. Then Harry cried aloud, as pain flared again within his scar. The mountain troll crumbled in on itself, becoming ashes hanging in the air, then dust, and then the dust seemed to blow away without going anywhere; it was gone. Hermione Granger slept on peacefully, whatever spell of repose Volde- mort had cast on her being sufficient to the task. “Um,” Harry said in a small voice. “Did it work?” “Diffindo.” Harry stepped forward with a choked yell, and then halted, both as the stupidity of his motion caught up with him, and as the sudden cut that the Severing Charm had opened on Hermione’s leg closed almost as quickly as it had been made. In seconds there was only a light stain of blood on the surrounding flesh. The Stone was laid again on Hermione, and after a time it turned. Voldemort laughed once more, as he passed his hand over her. “Marvel- lous.” Then another tiny tooth was floating within the circle of obelisks; and an instant later, a unicorn stood where the troll had stood before, eyes dull and head lowered. “What?” Harry said. “Why a unicorn?” “Power of unicorn'ss blood to presserve life makess excellent combination with troll'ss healing. Only Fiendfyre and Killing Cursse sshall girl-child fear, from thiss day.” A flicker of snakish laughter. “Bessidess, had sspare unicorn left over, might ass well usse.” “Unicorn’s blood has side effects—” “That iss only when power of unicorn'ss blood iss sstolen by another. Thiss sspell will make power of unicorn belong insside girl-child, ass if sshe wass alwayss born that way.” The grim chant and its seething words began again. Harry watched, not understanding in the slightest. Forget understanding, what am I seeing? I’m seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort going to enormous lengths to resurrect Her- mione Granger and keep her alive. It’s like he thinks that his own life depends on Hermione Granger being alive, somehow. The confused parts of Harry looked around for a procedure to follow. ‘Make a prediction based on your best current hypothesis’ was the first thought that came to mind, but it didn’t seem to lead anywhere. The plot of the story wasn’t going how it ought to, after the villain had won. Again the blaze of pain in his scar, like a blow to Harry’s forehead. The unicorn swayed, and then disintegrated as the troll had done. The Dark Lord laid the Stone upon Hermione’s form once more, clasp- ing her hands around it. Voldemort watched the unremarkable process for a time, then turned while the Stone still laid on her, making a high humming sound in his throat. “Ah, yess,” hissed Voldemort. “That would be mosst appropriate. Do you sstill have the diary I gave you, boy? The diary of the famouss sscientisst?” Harry’s brain took a moment to place what Voldemort was talking about. It had been in Mary’s Room, in Mary’s Place, in October, that pre- cious gift from a friend. The thought should have triggered a wave of awful sadness, for the Professor Quirrell that had been lost or never real; but there had been enough of that emotion already, and his brain had set it aside for now. “Yes,” Harry said aloud. “I think it’s in my pouch, can I check?” Harry knew it was in the pouch. He’d loaded it up with everything that he might possibly conceivably need, that he owned or had bought; everything that could have been a quest item. From the heap of items by the altar, Harry’s mokeskin pouch was drawn out, tossed to Harry’s feet. “Roger Bacon’s diary,” Harry said as he reached in a hand, and the di- ary appeared. Professor Quirrell had said that the diary would emerge un- scathed from a fire, so Harry threw it toward Voldemort’s altar. Harry did not wince; there were more important things to worry about than polite treatment of books, even that one. Voldemort picked up the diary, examining it, appearing quite ab- sorbed. Harry, as quietly and unobtrusively as he could, attached the pouch to his belt loop in back, where it wouldn’t be visible, near where Harry had put his wand. Step three, the pouch. “Yess,” Voldemort hissed as he flipped pages of the diary, “thiss will do quite well.” The Stone moved slightly, and the Dark Lord’s other hand stored the Stone again within his robes. “What was your hidden purpose behind the diary?” Harry said when the pouch was attached to his belt, and he’d put both of his empty hands where Voldemort could see them again. “I tried translating a little at the beginning, but it was going slowly—” Actually, it had been excruciatingly slow and Harry had found other priorities. “Diary wass exactly what it sseemed, a gift meant to sseduce you to my sside.” Voldemort made intricate gestures in the air with his wand, not even look- ing at what his hand was doing, as he held the diary in his other hand. For a moment Harry thought he could see a trail of darkness in the air, but the moonlight was too faint for certainty. “And now, my dear boy,” Volde- mort’s high voice was laced with grim amusement, as his wand briefly tapped Hermione Granger’s forehead with a casual gesture, “I make this diary into a far more precious gift, a sign of how much wisdom I have learned from you. For I would never want you to be deprived of Hermione Granger’s counsel and restraint, not ever while the stars yet live. Avada Kedavra.” The green bolt of the Killing Curse blazed out faster than Harry could possibly have cast the Patronus Charm, faster than he could possibly have moved, it was already over even as Harry cried out and went for his wand. Quirinus Quirrell’s unconscious body did not even jerk, in death. The green light struck into it without other sign. Darkness glowed in the air, anti-light in the trails that Voldemort had made before, and the Diary of Roger Bacon darkened as though corrup- tion were creeping over it, even as a shiver appeared in the air around Hermione Granger’s form. The pain in Harry’s scar flared overwhelmingly, like a brand driven into his forehead, it sent Harry dodging unthinkingly to one side as Tom Riddle’s reflexes took over. And Voldemort was also screaming, shrieking as he dropped the diary to the ground, holding his own head and screaming. Chance— The last voice of hope said that, as Harry tried frantically to think, to understand. There wasn’t any point in trying to kill Voldemort now, it might only annoy him, weapons couldn’t kill him while any of his hun- dreds of horcruxes remained— But it still seemed worth it to temporarily discarnate Voldemort, take the Stone and Hermione and run. Harry’s right hand had already taken his wand. His left hand went around to his back, reached awkwardly into his pouch, began to make a silent sign, three English letters. “No!” cried Voldemort. He’d dropped his hands from his head, was staring at Hermione’s body as though bewildered. “No, no!” The item came up from Harry’s pouch into his hand, and Harry began to step forward as smoothly as he could, diminishing the range between them to what his brief trials had shown was doable. “My great creation—” gasped Voldemort. His voice was high, sound- ing panicked. “Two different spirits cannot exist in the same world—it is gone, it is severed! A horcrux, I must make a horcrux at once—” Volde- mort’s gaze fell on Hermione Granger’s still-sleeping form, and he began to raise his wand in the air, executing the same gestures as before. Harry raised his gun and pulled the trigger three times. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND TWELV E FAILURE, PART II Even as Harry had raised the gun, he’d known he was making a mistake, his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand, but somehow the sick certainty didn’t propagate fast enough to prevent his finger from pulling the trigger— The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard. A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger, Voldemort had jabbed his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had shot up be- tween them from the graveyard earth, intercepting all three bullets. An instant after that, pain flared in Harry’s scar, a crawling feeling came close to his skin; and then Harry’s pouch, clothes, gun, everything except his wand disappeared, leaving him naked but for the wand still in his right hand, and the glasses he’d Charmed to stick to his nose. The steel ring upon his left pinky finger was yanked off hard enough to scrape skin, taking the Transfigured jewel with it. “That,” said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall, “was ab- solutely predictable. Do you really think I would shout it aloud for you to hear, if my immortality were disrupted? Really, stupid child? Lower your wand, do not raise it up again at any time, or you die upon the spot.” Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. “You would have been disappointed in me,” Harry said, his own voice now unusually high, “if I’d missed an opportunity like that, I mean.” There was no time to think, and Harry’s mouth was operating on autopilot for trying to placate evil overlords that might have paternal feelings for you and whom you’d just failed to assassinate. Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling that hor- rible smile that seemed to contain too many teeth. “I promised not to raise my hand or wand against you, child, if you did not raise your hand or wand against me.” “I used bullets,” Harry said, his voice still high. “That’s not a fist or a spell.” “My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you missed. Did you think I would leave the peace between us to mere fortune? Before I created you, I invoked a curse upon myself and all other Tom Riddles who would descend from me. A curse to enforce that none of us would threaten the others’ immortality, so long as the other made no attempt upon our own. Typical of that ridiculous fiasco, the curse seems to have ended up binding me, but taking no hold upon the infant with his self so lost.” A low, lethal chuckle. “But you tried to end my true life jusst then, sstupid child. Now cursse iss lifted, and I may kill you any time I wissh.” “I see,” Harry said. He did see; that was why Voldemort had told him about his horcrux system in the first place, just to set up the moment when Harry knowingly tried to violate his immortality. Harry’s mind was frantically churning through options, none of which seemed helpful. His pouch, his clothes, Harry saw by the moonlight that they all now lay in another heap by the altar, out of reach. “And now you kill me?” Harry still had his wand, presumably the Dark Lord couldn’t cast his own magic on that, or his glasses, because of the disharmony. Cast my own spell first? No, Voldemort just jabs his wand downward to make another shield, then shoots me— what else is there? What else? “Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I would al- ready have killed you.” The dirt wall crumbled at another gesture of the wand, and Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the heap of items by the altar. The Dark Lord stretched out a hand, and the diary of Roger Ba- con flew to him. “Thiss iss, indeed, horcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.” In his other hand appeared a parchment. “Thiss iss ritual for ressurrecting her, if it musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no trapss. Remember that girl- child'ss sspirit cannot float free like ghosst, Ressurrection Stone iss my horcrux, not herss. Do not losse her horcrux, or her sspirit may be trapped within it.” Voldemort reached down, picked up Harry’s pouch, fed both the diary and the parch- ment into it. “Remember that, in casse ssomething goess wrong with next movess.” “I don’t understand what is happening,” Harry said. There was noth- ing else left. “Please explain to me.” The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look. “When girl- child died, wass in company of sschool'ss Seer, heard prophecy sspoken that you would become force of vasst desstruction. You would become threat beyond imagination, be- yond apocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss to undo my killing of girl-child, keep it undone.” “Are,” what “are you sure,” what. “Dare not ssay sspecificss to you. Prophecy I heard of mysself led me to fulfil it. Have not forgotten that dissasster.” Voldemort backed further away from Harry, red-slitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwavering in the left hand. “All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that desstiny at every point of intervention. If ssome fate makess me fail in what comess next, idiot-child of foretold desstruction, then you musst kill yoursself to ssave girl-child. Elsse all you claim to value diess by your own hand.” “I,” Harry’s voice went up an octave, “I,” another octave, “I really really wouldn’t do that, seriously!” “Silence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to sspeak. Keep your wand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss told. Elsse you die upon the sspot, and mark that I ssaid that in Parsseltongue.” Voldemort reached into the altar again. For a second Harry’s mind couldn’t process what he was seeing, and then he saw that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed near the shoulder; it seemed too thin, that arm. The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed arm’s el- bow, and the fingers twitched, twitched like they were alive; by dim moon- light Harry saw a darker mark appear on that flesh, just above the elbow. Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the graveyard with the popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after that came an- other pop, and then another. The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled from the robes beneath them. “Master!” cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The voice was of peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask. “Master—it has been so long—we had lost hope—” “Silence!” shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Ev- ery trace of Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall figure. “Train your wand upon the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do not be distracted, not by anything! Stun him at once if he moves, if he begins to speak!” More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy spaces, more black robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked. Some of them voiced exclamations of joy, many of those sounding rather forced; others moved forwards as though to greet their Master. Voldemort gave them all the same instruction, except that some were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to restrain the Boy-Who-Lived if he moved, others told to fire hexes and curses, others told to cancel his magic. Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and skull masks seemed to stop arriving. All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry, aligned in a semicircle before him, where they wouldn’t get into each other’s lines of fire. Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he had been told that, if he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained silent, insofar as he had been told that if he tried to speak, he would die. He tried not to shiver in the falling night temperatures, for he was naked, and it was getting colder. You know, said the last voice within Harry, the voice of hope, I think this is getting pretty bad even by my standards. CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN E ND-OF-YEAR EXAM The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the dark- ness: all these illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming above black robes, and the darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes shone red. “Welcome, my Death Eaters,” spoke Lord Voldemort’s voice, smooth and high and terrible. “No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon the Pot- ter child! Ten years, it has been, ten years since we last met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday…” The Dark Lord Voldemort came near to one hooded figure, tapped fingers upon the mask. “In a hastily Trans- figured mockery of a Death Eater’s true armour, with a childish Charm to distort your voice. Explain, Mr Honour.” “Our old masks and robes…” said the robe whose mask the Dark Lord had tapped. Even through the distorting timbre of the mask, the fear in it was audible. “We…we were not fighting in them, Master, with you gone… so I did not maintain their enchantments…and then you summoned me to appear here, masked, and I…I always held faith in you, Master, but I did not know you would return this very day…I am truly sorry to have displeased you…” “Enough.” The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure, that seemed to tremble, though it kept its mask facing the Boy-Who- Lived, and its wand held level. “I might think more kindly of such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda by other means…Mr Counsel. Yet I return to find—what? A country conquered in my name?” The high voice climbed higher. “No! I find you playing ordinary politics in the Wizengamot! I find your brothers still abandoned in Azkaban! It is a disappointment to me…I confess myself disappointed…You thought I was gone, the Dark Mark dead, and you forsook my purpose. Is that right, Mr Counsel?” “No, Master!” cried that masked figure. “We knew you would return— but, but we could not fight Dumbledore without you—” “Crucio.” A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it contin- ued for long, long seconds. “Get up,” the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed upon the ground. “Keep your wand on Harry Potter. Do not lie to me again.” “Yes, Master,” sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its feet. Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. “I sup- pose you are also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here…Why he is a guest at my rebirthing party.” “I know, Master!” said one of the robes. “You mean to prove your power by killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to which of you is stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay even this so-called Boy- Who-Lived!” There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to speak. Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and dark robes, turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken. “That,” whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, “is a little too much folly for me to credit, Mr Sallow. You heard that theory of how I died, and tried to provoke me into repeating a mistake?” Lord Voldemort was floating, rising high off the ground. “I suppose you came to prefer your laziness to my mastery, Macnair?” The Death Eater who’d spoken was suddenly surrounded by a blue haze. He spun, slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried “Avada Ke- davra!” Voldemort simply tilted to one side in mid-air, dodging the green bolt. “Avada Kedavra!” cried the Death Eater. His hand that didn’t hold a wand was making other gestures, further colours and layers building up in his shielding haze with each gesture completed. “Help me, my broth- ers! If we all—” The Death Eater fell in seven flaming pieces to the ground, chunks of flesh with the cauterized edges still glowing. “Eyes and wands on Harry Potter, all of you,” Voldemort repeated, his voice low and dangerous. “And Macnair acted in sheer stupidity just then, for I command your Marks, as I always shall. I am immortal.” “Master,” said another robe. “The girl upon the altar—is she to serve us for a Dark Revel? She seems unworthy of such a joyous occasion. I could find better, Master, if you give me leave for just a short time—” “No, Mr Friendly,” said Voldemort, sounding rather amused. “The lit- tle witch you see upon the altar is none other than Hermione Granger—” “What?” cried one of the black robes, and then, “I’m sorry, Master, I’m sorry, I beg your—” “Crucio.” This screaming only lasted a few seconds, and Voldemort had performed it as though it were perfunctory. Afterwards Voldemort’s voice returned to low amusement. “I have resurrected this mudblood through the Darkest of magics, for my own purposes. You shall not offer her the slightest trouble, any of you. You are better off dead than if I learn my little experiment came to harm at your hands. This order is absolute, regardless of other circumstances—even if she escapes, let us say.” A cold high laugh, as if at some joke that nobody else understood. “Master,” one of the robes said in a faltering voice distorted by his skull mask. “Master, please—I would never defy you, I am obedient as you see—but Master, I beg you, let me return, the better to serve you later—I came here in haste, forsaking—Master, with so many of us being gone, others will wonder, they will mark the absences, who has disappeared. Soon there shall be no alibi I can offer.” A cold high laugh. “Ah, Mr White, the most delinquent of my servants. I have not yet decided if you will survive your punishment. I have less need of you than I once did, Mr White. In two days’ time the Death Eaters shall walk openly. My powers have increased, and I have just this day disposed of Dumbledore.” More gasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters, Volde- mort paid them no heed. “Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour, if they have not fled. The rest of you shall go into the Min- istry and the Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We are finished waiting. By tomorrow’s nightfall I shall have declared myself Lord Ruler of Britain!” Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure was laughing. “You find me amusing, Mr Grim?” “Apologies, Master,” said the robed figure who had laughed, his wand perfectly level upon where Harry stood. “I was glad to hear you had dis- patched Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear of him, having lost faith in your return.” Voldemort’s chuckle resounded within the graveyard. “Your candour earns you my mercy, Mr Grim. I was surprised to see you here tonight; you are more competent than I suspected. But before we turn our attention to happier matters, there is a certain affair to which we must attend. Tell me, Mr Grim, if the Boy-Who-Lived swore an oath to you, might you trust him?” “Master…I don’t understand…” said Mr Grim. One or two of the other Death Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before quickly fixing the skull gaze on Harry. “Answer me,” Voldemort hissed. “This is not a trick, Mr Grim, and you will answer truthfully or bear the consequences. You knew the boy’s fore- bears, did you not? Knew them for straightforward folk? If the boy freely chose to swear to you an oath, even knowing you for a Death Eater, might you trust in his words? Answer me!” Voldemort’s voice rose to a shriek. “I…yes, Master, I suppose I might…” “Good,” Voldemort said coldly. “The potential for trust must exist, to be sacrificed. And for the bonder of the Unbreakable Vow…which of you shall sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite the long Vow…much longer than usual…much magic shall be required for that…” Voldemort smiled his awful smile. “Mr White shall do.” “No, please! Master, I beg you! I served you better than any—as best I could—” “Crucio,” said Voldemort, and Mr White screamed through his mask’s distortion for what seemed like a full minute. “Be grateful if I leave you your life! Now approach the boy, Mr Grim, Mr White. From behind him, idiot! You must not block the others’ wands! And the rest of you, you must fire if Harry Potter tries to run, even if it means striking at your fellow Death Eaters.” Mr White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to shake, even as Mr Grim moved smoothly into position. “What is to be the Vow, Master?” came the voice of Mr Grim. “Ah, yes,” Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind the semicircle of Death Eaters. “Today—though I hardly expect even you to be- lieve me—today we are doing Merlin’s work, my Death Eaters. Yes! Before us stands a great danger, who in his blundering folly has been prophesied to wreak destruction such as even I can scarcely imagine. The Boy-Who- Lived! The boy who frightens Dementors! The cattle who believe they own this world should have been more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of them!” “Forgive me—” said one black robe in a halting voice. “Master—surely, if that is so—Master, why don’t we just kill him right away?” Voldemort laughed, a strange bitter laugh. When he spoke on his high voice was precise. “Here is the oath’s intent, Mr Grim, Mr White, Harry Potter. Listen well and comprehend the Vow that must be sworn, for its intent is also binding, and you three must share an understanding of its meaning. You will swear, Harry Potter, not to destroy the world, to take no risks when it comes to not destroying the world. This Vow may not force you into any positive action, on account of that, this Vow does not force your hand to any stupidity. Do you understand that, Mr Grim, Mr White? We are dealing with a prophecy of destruction. A prophecy! They can fulfil themselves in twisted ways. We must be cautious that this Vow itself does not bring that prophecy about. We dare not let this Vow force Harry Pot- ter to stand idly after some disaster is already set in motion by his hand, because he must take some lesser risk if he tries to stop it. Nor must the Vow force him to choose a risk of truly vast destruction, over a certainty of lesser destruction. But all Harry Potter’s foolishness,” Voldemort’s voice climbed, “all his recklessness, all his grandiose schemes and good intentions— he shall not risk them leading to disaster! He shall not gamble with the Earth’s fate! No researches that might lead to catastrophe! No unbind- ing of seals, no opening of gates!” Voldemort’s voice lowered again. “Un- less this very Vow itself is somehow leading into the destruction of the world, in which case, Harry Potter, you must ignore it in that particular regard. You will not trust yourself alone in making such a determination, you must confide honestly and fully in your trusted friend, and see if that one agrees. Such is this Vow’s meaning and intent. It forces only such acts as Harry Potter might choose himself, having learned that he is a prophe- sied instrument of destruction. For the capacity for choice must also exist, to be sacrificed. Do you understand, Mr White?” “I—I think so—oh, Master, please, do not let the Vow be so long—” “Silence, fool, you do a more useful thing this day than you have ever done. Mr Grim?” “I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me.” Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again using dif- ferent words. “And now,” Voldemort said coldly, “Harry Potter, you will keep your wand low, and permit Mr Grim to touch his wand to yours; and you will speak such words as I direct you. If Harry Potter speaks any other word, then cut him down, the rest of you.” “Yes, Master,” came the thirty-four-fold chorus. Harry was chilled, and shivering, and not only because he was naked in the night. He didn’t understand why Voldemort was not just killing him. There seemed to be only a single line leading into the future, and it was Voldemort’s chosen line, and Harry did not know what came after this. “Mr White,” said Voldemort. “Touch your wand to Harry Potter’s hand, and repeat these words. Magic that flows in me, bind this Vow.” Mr White spoke those words. Even through the distortion effect of his mask, it sounded as though his heart were breaking. Behind Voldemort the obelisks chanted, a language that Harry did not know; three times they repeated their words, then fell silent. “Mr Grim,” said Voldemort. “Think of the reasons why you might trust this boy, if he had given this oath freely. Think of that potential for trust, and sacrifice it as you say…” “By my trust that I hold for you,” said Mr Grim, “be you held.” And then it was Harry Potter’s turn to repeat Lord Voldemort’s words, and Harry did so. “I vow…” Harry said. His voice shook, but he spoke. “That I shall not… by any act of mine…destroy the world…I shall take no chances…in not de- stroying the world…if my hand is forced…I may take the course…of lesser destruction over greater destruction…unless it seems to me that this Vow itself…leads to the world’s end…and the friend…in whom I have confided honestly…agrees that this is so. By my own free will…” Harry could feel it, as the rite was invoked, the shining cords of power wrapping around his wand and Mr Grim’s wand, wrapping around his hand where Mr White’s wand touched it, wrapping around his self on some disturbingly abstract level. Harry could feel himself invoking his power of free choice, and he knew that his next words would sacrifice it, that this was absolutely the last chance to turn back. “…so shall it be,” said the coldly precise voice of Lord Voldemort. “…so shall it be,” Harry repeated, and he knew in that moment that the content of the Vow was no longer something he could decide whether or not to do, it was simply the way in which his body and mind would move. It was not a vow he could break even by sacrificing his life in the process. Like water flowing downhill or a calculator summing numbers, it was just a thing-Harry-Potter-would-do. “Did the Vow take, Mr White?” Mr White sounded like he was weeping. “Yes, Master…I have lost so much, please, I have been punished enough.” “Return to your places…” said Voldemort. “Good. All eyes on the Potter child, prepare to fire the instant he tries to flee, or raise his wand, or speak any word…” The Dark Lord floated high in the air, the black-clad figure overlooking the graveyard. Again he held a gun in his left hand, and his wand in his right. “Better. Now we shall kill the Boy-Who-Lived.” Mr White staggered. Mr Grim was laughing again, and so were oth- ers. “I did not do that to be funny,” Voldemort said coldly. “We are deal- ing with a prophecy, fools. We are snipping the threads of destiny one by one; carefully, carefully, not knowing when we may first encounter resis- tance. This is the order in which the next acts shall be done. First Harry Potter shall be stunned, then his limbs severed and the wounds cauter- ized. Mr Friendly and Mr Honour will examine him for any trace of un- usual magics. One of you shall shoot the boy many times with my Muggle weapon, and then as many of you as can shall strike him with the Killing Curse. Only then will Mr Grim crush his skull and brains with the mun- dane substance of a tombstone. I shall verify his corpse, then his corpse shall be burned with Fiendfyre, then we will exorcise the surrounding area in case he has left a ghost. I myself will guard this place until six hours have passed, for I do not fully trust the wards I have set against Time’s looping; and four of you shall search the surroundings for signs of any- thing noteworthy. Even after that we must remain vigilant for any sign of Harry Potter’s renewed presence, in case Dumbledore has left some unimagined trick in play. If you can think of any trick that I have missed in being sure that Harry Potter’s threat is ended, speak now and I shall reward you handsomely…speak now, in Merlin’s name!” There was stunned silence amid the cemetery; no-one made to speak. “Useless, the lot of you,” Voldemort said with bitter scorn. “Now I shall ask Harry Potter one final question, and he is to answer that question for my ears alone, in Parseltongue. Strike the boy down at once if he answers with anything but hisses, if he tries to speak one word of human speech.” Then Voldemort hissed, “Power I know not, it wass ssaid that you would have. The Muggle Artss I have now learned of from you, and I am already sstudying them. Your power over life-eaterss musst be comprehended for onesself, or sso you ssay. If there iss any other power you posssesss, that I may come to have, tell me of it now. Elsse, I intend to torment certain of thosse you care for. Some livess I have already promissed you, but otherss I did not. Your mudblood sservantss in your little army. Your preciouss parentss. All sshall ssuffer for what will sseem to them like eternitiess; and then I sshall ssend them, broken, into the life-eater prisson to remember it, until they wasste and die. For each unknown power you tell me how to masster, or other ssecret you tell me that I dessire to know, you may name one more of thosse to in- sstead be protected and honoured under my reign. Thiss alsso I promisse and intend to keep.” Voldemort’s smiling expression now came through as if it were a snake’s gaping fangs, and the meaning that expression bore among snakes, a promise that whoever beheld the teeth was to be consumed by them. “Wasste not time in thoughtss of esscape, if you care for thosse oness. You have ssixty ssecondss to begin telling me ssomething I wissh to know, and then your death beginss.” CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN SHUT UP AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE, PART I The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the dark- ness, all these shone down upon the graveyard to bear witness from their unimaginable distances. In the instant when Harry had realised there was no way at all left to save everyone, his mind’s voices had fallen away, become one, a single purpose taking up every fraction of his mind. Fifty seconds. Forty seconds. Harry’s eyes tracked slowly across the air, until his gaze landed on the first Death Eater, the one closest to him. Thirty seconds? Twenty seconds? “Time'ss almosst up—” hissed Voldemort. “I do know ssecretss you would like to know,” Harry hissed. He didn’t look directly at the Dark Lord as he spoke. “But mosst valuable knowledge to you, I think, would be my ideass ass to how world might be desstroyed. Yet, to tell you ssuch thoughtss might lead to desstruction of world. Do not know prophecy, but if there iss prophecy, that makess it more than ussually probable that any action I take might have that effect. Or to tell you ssuch might prevent desstruction of world, ssince you do sseem motivated to avoid it. Not allowed to make ssuch a decission mysself. Would need to awaken and conssult girl-child friend. Vow requiress.” There was a long pause. The Dark Lord, floating above and behind the curve of Death Eaters with levelled wands, began to laugh as Salazar Sly- therin had thought a snake would laugh, cold amusement in the form of a hiss. “Do you know how to desstroy world, then?” “Cannot deliberately try to imagine method. You might have way for sservant to ssteal my thoughtss. Vow prohibitss. But ssusspect I could devisse method, if girl-child ssaid to try.” Harry’s eyes drifted slowly to another Death Eater, and another. More snakish laughter. “Clever. You have my complimentss for thinking of ssuch tacticss. But no.” “Know it iss annoying, but with world and your eternity at sstake, would you not—” “Greater rissk to world in introducing ssuch complicationss, delaying your end. I will sstudy Muggle ssciencess mysself, think of all you might imagine. Now sspeak ssuch ssecretss ass you may tell me, or thiss endss.” Slowly Harry’s vision tracked across the graveyard in careful arcs, ignoring the Dark Lord except as a floating blackness in his peripheral vision. His mouth went on speaking with only half his attention. “Have thought of idea you might not have conssidered, teacher. Your attempt to kill me might fail in certain sspecific way desspite all your precautionss, perhapss lead into my desstroying world later. Would not ordinarily deem probable, but with prophecy at hand, may well be sso.” Voldemort went still, in the air. “How?” “Am not obliged to tell you.” A cold anger began to seethe through the snakish reply. “Though I under- sstand well your dessperation and attempted clevernesss, thiss beginss to annoy me. I will not withhold from killing you, for that iss sstill greater rissk. To fail to tell me your thought risskss desstroying world. Speak!” “No. Vow doess not oblige me to any possitive action.” The Dark Lord stared down at Harry Potter, who glanced up at the angry face only briefly before his eyes went back to the next Death Eater. Some of them were shifting their stances slightly, but they stood still, and said no words as they levelled their wands. The silver skull masks could not be read. Then the Dark Lord began to chuckle again. “Survive your death, you think you might? No, child, my horcruxess are not linked to you alsso. I would know if they were. Or iss there other reasson you think you might ssurvive beyond my wayss of en- ssuring your death?” Harry didn’t allow himself to be distracted. The repeated failures didn’t matter, they only led into the next action in the chain—but he still needed a next action— “Now sspeak a ssecret,” the Dark Lord hissed, “or I—” “Life-eaterss will purssue you alwayss, hate you alwayss, sseek you out wherever you go, if what I have jusst done wass ssuccesssful, I have caussed them to be sset upon you! Guardian Charm ssecret will be beyond you for long time to come, perhapss for- ever! Besst defence againsst life-eaterss would die with me!” “Thiss iss sstarting to become ssad…” the Dark Lord’s voice trailed off. “Ah. I ssee. Life-eaterss resspond to expectationss. You tell me I will be hunted, I expect to be hunted, they hunt me. Such iss rare, but not unheard-of. Valuable ssecret, yess. Can ssee many ussess.” A cruel smile. “I sshall allow you to sselect one persson to be ssaved.” “Mysself.” “Would tell you to die with dignity, but knowing mysself, I know it for futility. You have wassted my kindly gift jusst then by annoying me, and I retract it. Any other ssecretss?” “Yess. Really interessting oness, too. Some you are unlikely to figure out on your own, not for very long time if ever. If I ssay I have told you all that do not rissk world, will you not torment any of my friendss or family? All of thiss sspeech sstarted becausse you left me no way at all to ssave everyone.” The Dark Lord stood still in the air for a long moment. And Harry’s eyes went on tracking slowly across the graveyard, as his hand remained tight upon his wand. In the instant when Harry had realized there was no way left to save everyone— He couldn’t speak any incantation in English. But Transfiguration was wordless. There was no material in contact with his wand’s end except air, which couldn’t be Transfigured. But Voldemort didn’t know about partial Trans- figuration, which Harry could use to Transfigure a tiny bit of the material from his wand itself. “You're sstalling,” the Dark Lord said. “Jusst to delay death? Or with other pur- posse?” Harry said nothing, his other work slowing as his mind sought a continuation of the conversation that would work even against the Dark Lord’s will— “Speak and tell me purposse, or thiss endss now and your friendss ssuffer for life- timess!” “Lower Muggle weapon and do not point wand in my direction,” Harry hissed, putting as much cold danger as he could into the snake’s voice. “Speak no commandss to sservantss. I do posssesss capabilitiess of which you are ignorant. Can usse one ssuch capacity to causse huge explossion almosst insstantly, without sspeak- ing incantation. Slay your new body, all sservantss, Stone sscattered to who knowss where.” At his current level of practice Harry could Transfigure one cubic mil- limetre as fast as he could apply his will and magic. One cubic millimetre of antimatter. It wasn’t a world-ending threat. Voldemort could have been carved from stone. “You bluff, ssomehow.” “Not bluffing. Speaking in ssnaketalk, I tell you, I can do it almosst insstantly, be- fore any sspell can be casst at me, I think. You know very little of sscience ass yet. Power I would command iss sstronger than processs that fuelss sstarss.” “Vow will sstop you,” hissed Voldemort. “You cannot rissk world. Take no ris- skss, none, with clever ideass!” “Would not rissk world. I esstimated ssize of explossion, nowhere near that large.” “You do not know, fool! Cannot be ssure!” Voldemort’s hiss was climbing higher. “I am reassonably certain. Vow will not sstop me.” There was an increasing fury in Voldemort’s expression, and yet his hiss carried a tinge of fear. “I sshall wreak pain beyond imagining on all you care for—” “Shut up. I dissregard all ssuch threatss now, ass theory of gamess ssayss I sshould. Only reasson you make threatss iss that you expect me to resspond.” That, too, Harry had truly understood in the last extremity. “Offer me ssomething I want, teacher. For your new body, for your continued holding of Stone, for livess of your sservantss.” Harry’s mouth was running on automatic, his real attention else- where. Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line… From a tiny spot on the end of Harry’s wand, a cubic millimetre of anchor, stretched out a thin line of Transfigured spider-silk. It would have broken at once, if tested; it would have gone unremarked, if any had noticed its glint. Less than a tenth of a millimetre in cross-section, the tiny shape represented by the extended line of spider-silk was some- thing Harry could Transfigure swiftly, ten centimetres of length to a cubic millimetre of total volume; and Harry could Transfigure a cubic millimetre in a fraction of a second. He was forcing the Transfiguration outward, extending it through the air as fast as he could without risking the transformation. The tracing line of spider-silk looped around a Death Eater’s hood at neck level, returned to the pattern of threads. Voldemort’s face was now impassive. “You musst not leave here alive. Senssible people called good would alsso agree, thiss I tell you in ssnake'ss sspeech. But all your friendss I will treat kindly and protect under my reign, if you agree to die now ass good persson sshould.” The last Death Eater was looped. The pattern of spider-silk was com- plete. The web had been drawn with loops around all the Death Eater’s necks. The ends of those loops had been anchored to a central circle; and that central circle in turn had three threads stretching across its centre. The entire pattern still touching the anchor-line stretching out of Harry’s wand. Over the next seconds, those near-invisible threads of reflected moon- light turned black. Filaments narrower, stronger, and sharper than steel wire; braided carbon nanotubes, each individual tube all a single molecule. Harry hissed, “Want you to alsso promisse to treat nationss kindly under your rule. Will not accept lesss.” Voldemort hovered still in the air, snake-face showing a dawning fury. The last two threads stretched out from the dark pattern, black threads already in the form of nanotubes. They moved lightly through the air toward the Dark Lord himself, toward the sleeve just above Volde- mort’s left hand that held the gun, toward the sleeve above the right hand that held the yew wand, threads placed high at first to give them time to drift slowly downward through the air. The threads looped around, went over themselves, tied slippable knots. Began to tighten, coming closer to the sleeve, as Harry Transfigured them shorter— Harry felt the tickle of Voldemort’s power beginning to touch his own in the back of his mind; at the same time the Dark Lord’s eyes widened, his mouth opened. And Harry Transfigured the black threads stretching across the black pattern’s centre to a quarter their previous size, shrinking the circle, yank- ing hard on everything attached, tightening loops. (Black robes, falling.) Harry wasn’t looking there, he didn’t see the falling masks, the blood, in the back of his mind he felt some explosions of magic like he’d felt when Hermione died but he ignored them, Harry’s eyes only saw the Dark Lord’s hands and wand and gun dropping downward, and then Harry’s wand was rising, pointing— Harry screamed, “STUPORFY!” The red bolt the colour of the Stunning Hex winged toward Voldemort, blazing across the graveyard almost faster than the eye could see. Without any hesitation despite his wounds the Dark Lord jerked down and right through the air. And the red bolt from Professor Flitwick’s secret Swerving Stunner turned in mid-air and slammed into Voldemort. The pain that flashed through Harry’s scar was searing, it made him cry out and a red haze appear across his vision; despite everything, Harry dropped his wand in pain and sheer fatigue. As Harry let go of his wand, the pain began to clear— CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN SHUT UP AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE, PART II Something like a fugue state had come over Harry’s mind. The absolute state had partially worn off him, partially stayed with him. Elements of his mind were numb, maybe deliberately numbed by some part that was smart enough to predict what would happen otherwise. What he’d just done— The thought was shut off, making space for an awareness of other things. Harry was standing in the middle of a haphazard graveyard, tomb- stones scattered without order. By moonlight and starlight, it could be seen that black robes littered the ground, surrounded by textures that didn’t match the surrounding graveyard earth, wetness tinged red in the moonlight. Some heads had come loose from the surrounding hoods of the robes, revealing hair that was long or short, dark or bright, which was all that could be seen beneath the moon. The silver masks stayed on, making all the hair originate in skulls instead of human faces— The thought was shut off, making space for awareness of other things. A girl in a red-trimmed Hogwarts uniform slept upon an altar. Near the altar, Harry’s things lay in a heap. Upon the ground lay a too-tall pale man of inhuman face, blood pour- ing from the stumps of his wrists. As soon as the Dark Lord Voldemort awakens, he will destroy everything you love. Dumbledore is no longer there to stop him. He cannot be imprisoned, for he can abandon his body at any time. He cannot be killed permanently, not without destroying more than a hundred horcruxes, one of which is the Pioneer plaque. Materials: One wand, you are allowed to point it and speak this time. You have five minutes. Solve. Harry stumbled toward the altar, knelt at its side, and picked up his pouch. He walked toward where Voldemort lay. The sense of apprehension had diminished, after Voldemort had been hexed unconscious. Now, as Harry approached, it rose to a terrifying height, flaring also into pain in his scar. Harry ignored the inner shriek. That had been the last memory of Tom Riddle seared into Harry’s brain, the last cognitive pattern to be trans- ferred over into the infant baby before Tom Riddle had exploded: a sense of mounting horror and dismay associated with the resonance that had spun out of control. Harry knew the meaning of it now, that sense of ap- prehension, and that made it easier to disregard. He’d guessed that the effect of the resonance mostly hit the caster, with power proportional to the caster’s power, and the bet had paid off. Harry looked upon Voldemort’s body, and breathed deeply—through his mouth, because coppery smells Harry was not thinking about were coming in through his nose. Harry knelt by Voldemort’s side, took out his medical kit from his pouch, and placed a self-tightening tourniquet around the body’s left wrist, then another tourniquet about the right. It felt wrong, showing Voldemort that concern. Some part of Harry was aware, in the back of his mind, that some number of people had just had something extremely bad happen to them. What would have been bal- ance, what would have been justice, was if Voldemort had suffered the same fate without an instant’s more hesitation. What Harry was doing now felt like Batman showing more concern for the Joker than for the Joker’s victims; it felt like a comic book where the writers wrung their hands endlessly about the morality of killing the Big Named Villains while innocents went on dying in the background. To show more solicitousness for the head villain than his minions, to pay more attention to his fate than the fates of his lower-status followers, was a flaw in human nature. So it felt wrong when Harry rose up from beside the body, the tourni- quets having tightened upon Voldemort’s wrists; it felt like Harry was do- ing something ethically monstrous. Even though any sane strategic thinking said that Voldemort’s body must not die. The soul he’d created for himself had to be anchored in this brain, it mustn’t be allowed to float free. Harry stepped back, back from Voldemort’s unconscious body, breathing deeply through his mouth. He went to the pile of his things, to put on his robes and other items, starting with placing the Time-Turner around his throat once more, readying his own escape and return if that was required… More than a hundred horcruxes. That had been insane, there wasn’t any other word for it, a sign of Voldemort’s damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security expert would have called it fence-post security, like building a fence-post over a hundred metres high in the middle of the desert. Only a very obliging at- tacker would try to climb the fence-post. Anyone sensible would just walk around the fence-post, and making the fence-post even higher wouldn’t stop that. Once you forgot to be scared of how impossible the problem was sup- posed to be, it wasn’t even difficult, not by comparison to the last one. Neville’s parents, for example, had been Crucioed into permanent in- sanity. Two hundred advanced horcruxes wouldn’t prevent that insanity, they would all just echo the same damaged mind. It would be an ethically justified use of the Cruciatus Curse, if that were the only way to stop Voldemort permanently. It would be justice, balance, it would show that the Joker’s life wasn’t worth more than his meanest henchman… All Harry needed to do was cast the Patronus Charm, send it to… Alastor Moody? …and tell him to come here. Well, no, it was a pretty good guess the Patronus Charm wouldn’t work if it was cast with that intent. Maybe just resolve to tell Moody that, and use his Time-Turner once he was out of range of Voldemort’s wards. And then Voldemort could be Crucioed into permanent insanity. It wasn’t even the least merciful fate. That would have been throwing Voldemort’s wand into the pit at Azkaban, if the wand stayed connected to Voldemort’s life and magic no matter where his ghost tried to flee. Harry turned to face where Voldemort lay. He walked forward, and continued to control his breathing, ignoring the burning feeling in his throat. Some part of him knew that Voldemort was also Professor Quirrell, even though his body now was different. Even though the shift of person- ality had been perfect and that meant that Professor Quirrell had been just another mask… Though Voldemort hadn’t planned to kill Harry painfully. Hadn’t thought to strike Harry with his followers’ Cruciatus, when Harry was being annoying before. That meant something, when your opponent was Voldemort. Maybe he’d had some remaining shred of fellow-feeling for the other Tom Riddle after all. …it would be wrong to take that into account. Wouldn’t it? Harry looked back up at the stars. Here below the atmosphere the stars twinkled, they were embedded in the false dome of the night sky, stretched out across the wash of the Milky Way that glowed like a long rib- bon, as if they were all close enough that you could fly up to them on a broomstick and touch them. What would they want him to do now at this juncture, the children’s children’s children? The answer to that also felt obvious, if it wasn’t just the part of Harry that still cared about Professor Quirrell doing the real talking. Harry had needed to do the thing he’d done, it had prevented greater evils, Harry couldn’t have stopped Voldemort if the Death Eaters had fired first. But that thing Harry had done wasn’t something that could be bal- anced by an unnecessary tragedy happening to one more sentient being, even if that being was Voldemort. It would just be one more element of the sorrows of ancient Earth so long ago. The past was past. You did what you had to do, and you didn’t do one scrap of harm more than that. Not even to balance things out, and make it all symmetrical. The children’s children’s children wouldn’t want Voldemort to die, even if his minions had. They wouldn’t want Voldemort to hurt, if it didn’t accomplish anything compared to him not hurting. Harry breathed deeply, and let go of—not his hate—not quite his hate—he hadn’t been able to hate his creator even at the very end—but even so, Harry let go of something. Of the sense that he ought to hate Voldemort, that it was a hate he was obliged to feel, for the endless list of crimes that Voldemort had committed for no good reason, not even his own happiness… It’s all right, the stars whispered down at him. It’s all right not to hate him. It doesn’t make you a bad person. In the end, there was only one option he would take, and since Harry already knew that, there was no point agonizing about it. Whether it was the best option, only time would tell. Harry breathed deeply, building up the magic inside himself. The spell he was going to cast didn’t need to be precise, but it was still one of the most powerful spells he’d mastered. Harry thought again of how unjust it was that Voldemort could not die with his followers, felt the slight trace of coldness in his blood that came with thoughts of ruthlessness. And then Harry let it go, let it all drain away beneath the starlight, because his dark side had never been anything ex- cept an inherited pattern of cognition, just one more bad habit of thinking to break. Instead Harry looked at Hermione’s breathing form atop the altar, and let the tears finally start from his eyes. What would become of Hermione now, what path she would choose after this, Harry couldn’t guess; but she would be there to have a choice, their friendship wouldn’t have destroyed her existence. He hadn’t realised how shaky his hope had been, until he’d noticed how surprised he’d been after the hope had come true. Sometimes things did go better than expected. And Harry took that thought, too, and put it into the magic he was building. The power he was storing up was vibrating in him, like his whole body was part of his wand, either Harry’s eyes were blurring or there was a lu- minous white quiver running over the holly. And Harry thought the shape of the spell he would cast, he didn’t have much fine control but the pattern he needed was simple, it just needed to include— Everything, forget everything, Tom Riddle, Professor Quirrell, forget your whole life, forget your entire episodic memory, forget the disappointment and the bitterness and the wrong decisions, forget Voldemort— And at the last moment before Harry cast the spell, he had one final thought, a note of grace— But if you ever had any truly happy memories, not hurting people or laugh- ing at their pain, but the warm feeling of helping someone or being helped, there won’t be many, maybe just when you were a child, but if you had any truly happy memories then keep only those— Something bright in him unfolded at the decision, knowing he’d made the right choice, and Harry pushed that too into his wand— “Obliviate!” And it all poured out of Harry into the spell. Harry fell over on his side, dropping his wand, strangled screams com- ing from his throat, his hands going helplessly to his scar, even as the sudden blast of pain in his head began to fade. Only dimly did his eyes see that the air was filled with glowing snowflakes, drifting motes of silver light like tiny specks of Patronus Charm. Only a moment the silver light lasted, and then it was gone. Professor Quirrell was gone. Nothing left but a remnant. And that spirit, what remained of it, wouldn’t be so different now from Harry’s own. The Prophecy was complete. They had each remade the other in their own image. Harry started sobbing, then, from where he was curled up in the dirt. He cried for a while. And then eventually Harry staggered to his feet and picked up his wand again, because this day’s work wasn’t quite done. 1848 SHUT UP AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE II 1849 CH APTER 1 15 1850 SHUT UP AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE II 1851 CH APTER 1 15 1852 1853 CH APTER 1 16 1854 AFTERMATH, SOMETHING TO PROTECT 0 1855 CH APTER 1 16 1856 AFTERMATH, SOMETHING TO PROTECT 0 1857 CH APTER 1 16 1858 AFTERMATH, SOMETHING TO PROTECT 0 1859 1861 CH APTER 1 17 1862 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: MINERVA MCGONAGALL 1863 CH APTER 1 17 1864 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: MINERVA MCGONAGALL 1865 CH APTER 1 17 1866 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: MINERVA MCGONAGALL 1867 1869 CH APTER 1 18 1870 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: PROFESSOR QUIRRELL 1871 CH APTER 1 18 1872 1873 CH APTER 1 19 1874 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1875 CH APTER 1 19 1876 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1877 CH APTER 1 19 1878 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE If you are reading this, Harry Potter, then I have fallen to Voldemort, and the quest now lies in your hands. Though it may shock you to learn, this was the end that I wished in my heart w ould come to pass. For as I write this, it yet seems possible that Voldemort may fall by my own hand. And then, in time, I shall myself become the darkness you must overcome, to enter fully into your power. For it was said once that you might need to raise your hand against your mentor, the one who made you, who you loved; it was said that you might be my downfall. If you are reading this, then that shall never come to pass, and I am glad of it. Even so, Harry, I w ould spare you this, the lonely fight against Voldemort. I write this, vowing to shelter you as long as I can, no matter the final cost to myself. But if I have failed, then know that I am glad of it, in my own selfish way. With my passing, there is none left to oppose Voldemort as an equal save you. His shadow will fall long and terrible over magical Britain, and many will suffer and die for it. That shadow will not lift until you destroy its source, until you cleanse the heart of the darkness. How you are to do this, I do not know. If Voldemort knows not the power you bear, then neither do I. You must find that power w ithin yourself, you must learn to wield it, you must become Voldemort’s final judge, and I beg you not to make the error of showing him mercy. My wand, which I have left to you in Moody’s keeping, you must not dare to wield against Voldemort. For when that wand’s master is defeated, it passes to the victor in turn. When you have conquered my conqueror, then the wand will answer truly to your hand; but if you try to turn it against Voldemort before then, it will betray you for certain. Keep it out of Voldemort’s grasp at all costs. I should advise you not to wield that wand at all, yet it is a device of great power, which you might need in some desperate case. But if you pick it up you must fear its treachery at all times. In my absence, the Wizengamot will inevitably fall to Malfoy. The L ine of Merlin Unbroken I have passed to you, with Amelia Bones as your regent, until you come of age or come into your power. But she cannot oppose Malfoy for long, not with myself gone and Voldemort returned to advise him. Soon, I think, the Ministry will fall, and Hogwarts will become the last fortress. To Minerva I have left Hogwarts’s keys, but you alone are its prince, and she will help you however she can. Alastor now leads the Order of the Phœnix. Heed his w ords well, both his advice and his confidences. It is one of my life’s greatest regrets that I did not heed Alastor more and sooner. That you will in the end defeat Voldemort, I have no doubt. For that will be only the beginning of your life’s destiny. Of that, too, I am certain. When you have vanquished Voldemort, when you have saved this country, then, I hope, you may embark upon the true meaning of your days. Hurry then to begin. Yours in death (or in whatever), Dumbledore. P.S. The passw ords are ‘phœnix’s price’, ‘phœnix’s fate’, and ‘phœnix’s egg’, spoken within my office. Minerva can move those rooms to where you can reach them more easily. 1881 CH APTER 1 19 Dear Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres: If you are reading this, you have defeated Voldemort. Congratulations on that. I hope you had some time in which to celebrate before you opened this scroll, because the news in it is not cheerful. During the First Wizarding War, there came a time when I realised that Voldemort was winning, that he w ould soon hold all within his hand. In that extremity, I went into the Department of Mysteries and I invoked a passw ord which had never been spoken in the history of the L ine of Merlin Unbroken, did a thing forbidden and yet not utterly forbidden. I listened to every prophecy that had ever been recorded. And so I learned that my troubles were far w orse than Voldemort. From certain seers and diviners have come an increasing chorus of foretellings that this w orld is doomed to destruction. And you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, are one of those fore- told to destroy it. By rights I should have ended your line of possibility, stopped you from ever being born, as I did my best to end all the other possibilities I discovered on that day of terrible awakening. Yet in your case, Harry, and in your case alone, the prophecies of your apocalypse have loopholes, though those loopholes be ever so slight. Always ‘he will end the w orld’, not ‘he will end life’. Even when it was said that you w ould tear apart the very stars in heaven, it was not said that you w ould tear apart the people. And so, it being clear that this w orld is not meant to last, I have gambled literally everything upon you, Harry James Potter-Evans- Verres. There were no prophecies of how the w orld might be saved, so I found the prophecies that offered loopholes in the destruction; and I brought about the strange and complex conditions for those prophecies to come to pass. I ensured that Voldemort discovered a certain one of those prophecies, and so (even as I had feared) condemned your parents to death and made you what you are. I wrote a strange hint in your mother’s Potions textbook, having no idea why I must; and this proved to show L ily how to help her sister, and ensured you w ould gain Petunia Evans’s heartfelt love. I sneaked invisibly into your bedroom in Oxford and administered the potion that is given to students with Time-Turners, to extend your day’s cycle by tw o hours. When you were six years old I smashed a rock that was on your windowsill, and to this day I cannot imagine why. All in the desperate hope that you can pass us through the eye of the storm, somehow end this w orld and yet bring out its people alive. Now that you have passed the preliminary test of defeating Voldemort, I place my all in your hands, all the tools I can possibly give you. The L ine of Merlin Unbroken, the command of the Order of the Phœnix, all my wealth and all my treasures, the Elder Wand of the Deathly Hallows, the loyalty of such of my friends as may heed me. I have left Hogwarts in Minerva’s care, for I do not think you will have time for it, but even that is yours if you demand it from her. One thing I do not give you, and that is the prophecies. Upon the moment of my departure, they will be destroyed, and no future ones will be recorded, for it was said that you must not look upon them. If you think this frustrating, believe me when I say that even your wit cannot comprehend what frustration you have been spared. I will die, or be lost by you, or in some other way be taken from you—the prophecies are unclear, naturally—without ever once knowing what the future truly holds, or why I must do what I do. It is all cryptic madness and you are well rid of it. There can only be one king upon the chessboard. There can only be one piece whose value is beyond price. That piece is not the w orld, it is the w orld’s peoples, wizard and Muggle alike, goblins and house elves and all. While survives any remnant of our kind, that piece is yet in play, though the stars should die in heaven. And if that piece be lost, the game ends. Know the value of all your other pieces, and play to win. —Albus 1884 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1885 CH APTER 1 19 1886 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1887 CH APTER 1 19 1888 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1889 CH APTER 1 19 189 0 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1891 CH APTER 1 19 1892 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1893 CH APTER 1 19 1894 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1895 CH APTER 1 19 1896 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1897 CH APTER 1 19 1898 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: ALBUS DUMBLE DORE 1899 CH APTER 1 19 1900 1901 CH APTER 12 0 1902 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: DRACO MALFOY 1903 CH APTER 12 0 The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy Headmistress had held court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now there was only the waiting to see what would become of him, the orphan ward of Hogwarts, whose life and happiness lay in the hands of his family’s enemies. The boy had been called to this room, and he had come, because there was nothing else to do, and nowhere else to go. Vincent and Gregory had left his side, called back by their mothers for their fathers’ hurried funerals. Perhaps the boy should have gone with them, but he could not bring himself to do so. He would not have been able to act the part of a Malfoy. The feeling of emptiness that filled him up was so profound that it left no room even for lies. Everyone was dead. Everyone was dead, and it had all been futile from the beginning. There was a knock upon the office door, and then, after a polite pause, it opened to reveal Headmistress McGonagall, dressed much as she had dressed when she was a Professor. “Mr Malfoy?” his family’s victorious enemy said. “Please come with me.” Listlessly, Draco rose up, and followed her out of the office. Seeing Harry Potter waiting beside her gave him some pause, but then his mind simply shut it out. “Here’s the last thing,” Harry Potter said. “I found it in a folded parch- ment whose outside said that it was the last weapon to be used against House Malfoy, telling me not to read any further until the whole war hung in the balance. I didn’t want to tell it to you before because I thought it might prejudice your decision unfairly. If you were a good person who never killed or lied, but you had to do one or the other, which would be worse?” Draco ignored him and continued in Headmistress McGonagall’s company, leaving Harry behind looking sadly after. They came to the Headmistress’s old office, where she lit her Floo-fire with a wave of her wand, said to the green flame “Gringotts travel office” and stepped through after a firm glance in his direction. For lack of any other option, Draco Malfoy followed. 1905 CH APTER 12 0 1906 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: DRACO MALFOY 1907 1909 CH APTER 12 1 1910 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: SE V ERUS SNAPE 1911 CH APTER 12 1 1912 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: SE V ERUS SNAPE 1913 1915 CH APTER 12 2 1916 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: HERMIONE GRANG ER 1917 CH APTER 12 2 1918 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: HERMIONE GRANG ER 1919 CH APTER 12 2 192 0 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: HERMIONE GRANG ER 1921 CH APTER 12 2 192 2 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: HERMIONE GRANG ER The sky had gone full blue-grey, dawn barely short of sunrise, by the time that Harry heard the sound of footsteps coming from the ladder that opened into his new office. Hastily Harry stood up and began to brush off his robes; and then, realising what he was doing, stopped the nervous motions. He’d just defeated Voldemort, damn it, he ought not to be this nervous. The young witch’s head and chestnut curls appeared in the opening and peered around. Then she rose up higher, seemed almost to run up the ladder steps, like she was walking along an ordinary pavement but verti- cally; Harry could have blinked and missed it, how her shoe came down on the top rung of the ladder and then she leaped lightly onto the roof an instant later. Hermione. Harry’s lips moved around the word, but made no sound. There’d been something Harry had meant to say, but it had gone right out of his mind. Maybe a quarter of the minute passed, on the rooftop, before Hermi- one Granger spoke. She was wearing a blue-edged uniform now, and the blue-bronze-striped tie of her proper House. “Harry,” said Hermione Granger, a terribly familiar voice that almost brought tears to Harry’s eyes, “before I ask you all the questions, I’d like to start by saying thank you very much for, um, whatever it is you did. I mean it, really. Thank you.” “Hermione,” Harry said, and swallowed. The phrase may I have per- mission to hug you, which Harry had imagined using for his opening line, seemed impossible to say. “Welcome back. Hold on while I put up some privacy spells.” Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, got a book from his pouch that he opened to a bookmark, and then carefully pronounced “Hominem Revelio,” along with two other recently-acquired security Charms that Harry had found himself barely able to cast if he wielded the Elder Wand. It wasn’t much, but it was marginally better security than just relying on Professor Vector. “You have Dumbledore’s wand,” Hermione said. Her voice was hushed, and sounded as loud as an avalanche in the still dawn air. “And you can use it to cast fourth-year spells?” Harry nodded, making a mental note to be more careful who else saw him do that. “Is it okay if I hug you?” Hermione moved lightly over to him; her movements were peculiarly swift, more graceful than they’d been before. Her motions seemed to ra- diate an air of something pure and untouched, reminding Harry again of how peaceful Hermione had looked when she was sleeping on Volde- mort’s altar— Realization hit Harry like a ton of bricks, or at least a kilogram of brick. And Harry hugged Hermione, feeling how very alive she seemed. He felt like crying, and suppressed it, because he didn’t know whether that was just her aura affecting him or not. Hermione’s arms around him were gentle, exceedingly light in their pressure, as if she were being deliberately careful not to snap his body in half like a used toothpick. “So,” Hermione said, once Harry had let go of her. Her young face looked very serious, as well as pure and innocent. “I didn’t tell the Aurors you were there, or that it was Professor Quirrell and not You-Know-Who who killed all the Death Eaters. Professor Flitwick only let them give me one drop of Veritaserum, so I didn’t have to say. I just told them the troll was the last thing I remembered.” “Ah,” Harry said. He had somehow found himself staring at Hermi- one’s nose instead of her eyes. “What do you think happened, exactly?” “Well,” Hermione Granger said thoughtfully, “I got eaten by a troll, which I’d frankly rather not do again, and then there was a really loud bang and my legs were back, and I was lying on a stone altar in the middle of a graveyard in a dark moonlit forest I’d never seen before, with some- body’s severed hands clutched around my throat. So you see, Mr Potter, finding myself in a situation that weird and dark and scary, I wasn’t going to make the same mistake I did last time with Tracey. I knew right away that it was you.” Harry nodded. “Good call.” “I said your name, but you didn’t answer,” said Hermione. “I sat up and one of the bloody hands slid down over my shirt, leaving little bits of flesh behind. I didn’t scream though, even when I looked around and saw all the heads and bodies and realized what the smell was.” Hermi- one stopped, took another deep breath. “I saw the skull masks and re- alized that the dead people had been Death Eaters. I knew right away that the Defence Professor had been there with you and killed them all, but I didn’t notice Professor Quirrell’s body was also there. I didn’t real- ize it was him even when I saw Professor Flitwick checking the body. He looked…different, when he was dead.” Hermione’s voice became quieter. She looked humbled somehow, in a way Harry couldn’t often remember seeing. “They said David Monroe sacrificed his life to bring me back, the same way your mother sacrificed herself for you, so that the Dark Lord would explode again when he tried to touch me. I’m pretty sure that’s not the whole truth, but…I’ve thought a lot of nasty things about our Defence Professor that I never should’ve thought.” “Um,” Harry said. Hermione nodded solemnly, her hands clasped in front of her as though in penitence. “I know you’re probably too nice to say the things to me that you have a right to say now, so I’ll say them for you, Harry. You were right about Professor Quirrell, and I was wrong. You told me so. David Monroe was a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin, and it was childish of me to think that was the same thing as being evil.” “Ah…” Harry said. This was very hard to say. “Actually, the rest of the world doesn’t know this part, not even the Headmistress. But in point of fact you were one hundred and twelve percent correct about him be- ing evil, and I’ll remember for future reference that although ‘Dark’ and ‘evil’ may not technically be the same thing, there’s a great big statistical correlation.” “Oh,” said Hermione, and fell silent again. “You’re not saying that you told me so?” said Harry. His mental model of Hermione was yelling: I told you so! Didn’t I tell you so, Mr Pot- ter? Didn’t I tell you? Professor Quirrell is eeeeviiil, I said, but you didn’t listen to me! The actual Hermione just shook her head. “I know you cared about him a lot,” she said softly. “Since I was right after all…I knew you’d proba- bly be hurting a lot after Professor Quirrell turned out to be evil, and that it wouldn’t be a good time to say I told you so. I mean, that’s what I decided when I was thinking that part through several months earlier.” Thank you, Miss Granger. Harry was glad she’d said that much, though, it just wouldn’t have felt like Hermione otherwise. “So, Mr Potter,” said Hermione Granger, tapping her fingers on her robe at around thigh level. “After the medi-witch drew my blood, it stopped hurting right away, and when I brushed away the little bit of blood on my arm, I couldn’t find where the needle had poked me. I bent some of the metal in my bed frame without trying hard, and though I haven’t had a chance to test it yet, I feel like I should be able to run really fast. My fingernails are pearly white and shiny even though I don’t remember painting them. And my teeth look like that too, which, be- ing the daughter of dentists, makes me nervous. So it’s not that I’m ungrateful, but just what exactly did you do?” “Um,” Harry said. “And I’m expecting you’re also wondering why you’re radiating an aura of purity and innocence?” “I’m what?” “That part wasn’t my idea. Honestly.” Harry’s voice went small. “Please don’t kill me.” Hermione Granger raised her hands in front of her face, staring some- what cross-eyed at her fingers. “Harry, are you saying…I mean, my radi- ating innocence and being all fast and graceful and my teeth being pearly white…is it alicorn my fingernails are made of?” “Alicorn?” “It’s the term for unicorn horn, Mr Potter.” Hermione Granger seemed to be trying to nibble her fingernails, and not having much luck. “So, I guess if you bring a girl back from the dead she ends up as, what did Daphne call it, a Sparkling Unicorn Princess?” “That’s not exactly what happened,” Harry said, though it was fright- eningly close. Hermione took her finger out of her mouth, frowning at it. “I can’t bite through it either. Mr Potter, did you consider the problems now that it’s literally impossible for me to trim my fingernails and toenails?” “The Weasley twins have a magical sword that should work,” Harry vol- unteered. “I think,” Hermione Granger said firmly, “that I would like to know the whole story behind all this, Mr Potter. Because knowing you and knowing Professor Quirrell, there was some sort of plan going on.” Harry took a deep breath. Then he exhaled. “Sorry, it’s…classified. I could tell you if you studied Occlumency, but…do you want to?” “Do I want to study Occlumency?” Hermione said, looking slightly sur- prised. “That’s at least a sixth-year thing, isn’t it?” “I learned it,” Harry said. “I started with an unusual boost, but I doubt that really mattered in the long run. I mean, I’m sure you could learn cal- culus if you studied hard, regardless of what age Muggles usually learn it. The question is, um.” Harry was having to control his breathing. “The question is, do you still want to do…that kind of stuff.” Hermione turned, and looked at where the sky was lightening in the east. “You mean,” she said quietly, “do I still want to be a hero now that it’s earned me a horrible death that one time.” Harry nodded, then said “Yes” because Hermione wasn’t turning to- ward him, though the word felt blocked in his throat. “I’ve been thinking about that,” Hermione said. “It was, in fact, an ex- ceptionally gruesome and painful death.” “I, um. I did set some things up just in case you still wanted to be a hero. There were some short windows of opportunity where I didn’t have time to consult you, I couldn’t let you see me because I expected you to be given Veritaserum later. But if you don’t like it, I can undo most of what I did and you can just ignore the rest.” Hermione nodded distantly. “Like making everyone think that I… Harry, did I actually do anything to You-Know-Who?” “No, that was all me, though please don’t tell anyone that. Just so you know, that time the Boy-Who-Lived supposedly defeated Voldemort, on the night of Halloween in 1981, that was Dumbledore’s victory and he let everyone think it was me. So now I’ve defeated a Dark Lord once, and had the credit for it once. It all balances out eventually, I guess.” Hermione went on gazing to the east. “I’m not really comfortable with this,” she said after a while. “People thinking I defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, when I haven’t done anything at all…oh, that’s the same thing you went through, isn’t it?” “Yeah. Sorry about inflicting that on you. I was…well, I was trying to create a separate identity for you in people’s minds, I guess. There was just the one opportunity and everything was sort of rushed and…I real- ized afterwards that maybe I shouldn’t have, but it was too late.” Harry cleared his throat. “Though, um. If you’re feeling like you want to do some- thing that’s actually worthy of the way people think about the Girl-Who- Revived, um. I might have an idea for what you can do. Very soon, if you want.” Hermione Granger was giving him a look. “But you don’t have to!” Harry said hastily. “You can just ignore this whole thing and be the best student in Ravenclaw! If that’s what you pre- fer.” “Are you trying to use reverse psychology on me, Mr Potter?” “No! Honestly!” Harry took a deep breath. “I’m trying not to decide your life for you. I thought I saw, yesterday, I thought I saw what might come next for you—but then I remembered how much of this year I’d spent being a total idiot. I thought of some things Dumbledore said to me. I realized it genuinely wasn’t my place to say. That you could do any- thing you wanted with your life, and that above all, the choice had to be your own. Maybe you don’t want to be a hero after this, maybe you want to become a great magical researcher because that’s who Hermione Gran- ger really was all along, never mind what your fingernails are made out of now. Or you could go to the Salem Witches’ Institute in America instead of Hogwarts. I won’t lie and say I’d like that, but it really is up to you.” Harry turned to the horizon and swept his hand wide, as though to indicate all the world that lay beyond Hogwarts. “You can go anywhere from here. You can do anything with your life. If you want to be a wealthy sixty-year-old merman, I can make it happen. I’m serious.” Hermione nodded slowly. “I’m curious about how you’d do that ex- actly, but what I want isn’t to have things done for me.” Harry sighed. “I understand. Um…” Harry hesitated. “I think…if it helps you to know…in my case, things were being arranged for me a lot. By Dumbledore, mostly, though Professor Quirrell too. Maybe the power to earn your own way in life is itself something you have to earn.” “Why, that sounds very wise,” Hermione said. “Like my parents pay- ing for me to go to university, so I can some day get my own job. Profes- sor Quirrell bringing me back to life as a Sparkling Unicorn Princess and you telling everyone that I offed the Dark Lord Voldemort is just like that, really.” “I am sorry,” Harry said. “I know I should’ve done it differently, but…I didn’t have much time to plan and I was exhausted and not really thinking straight—” “I’m grateful, Harry,” Hermione said, her voice softer now. “You’re be- ing too harsh on yourself, even. Please don’t take it so seriously when I’m sarcastic to you. I don’t want to be the sort of girl who comes back from the dead, and then starts complaining about which superpowers she got and that her alicorn fingernails are the wrong shade of pearly white.” Her- mione had turned, was again gazing off at the east. “But, Mr Potter…if I do decide that dying a horrible death isn’t enough to make me rethink my life choices…not that I’m saying that just yet…then what happens next?” “I do my best to support you in your life choices,” Harry said firmly. “Whatever they are.” “You have a quest already lined up for me, I’m guessing. A nice safe quest where there’s no chance of my getting hurt again.” Harry rubbed his eyes, feeling tired inside. It was like he could hear the voice of Albus Dumbledore inside his head. Forgive me, Hermione Gran- ger… “I’m sorry, Hermione. If you go down that path I’m going to have to Dumbledore you, and not tell you some things. Manipulate you, if only for a short while. I do believe there’s something you might be able to do now, something real, something worthy of the way people are thinking about the Girl-Who-Revived…that you might have a destiny, even…but in the end that’s just a guess, I know a lot less than Dumbledore did. Are you willing to risk the life you just got back?” Hermione turned to look at him, her eyes widening in surprise. “Risk my life?” Harry didn’t nod, because that would have been outright lying. “Are you willing to do that?” Harry said instead. “The quest that I think might be your destiny—and no, I don’t know any specific prophecies, it’s just a guess—involves literal descent-into-Hell type stuff.” “I thought…” Hermione said. She sounded uncertain. “I thought for sure that after this, you and Professor McGonagall wouldn’t…you know… let me do anything the least bit dangerous ever again.” Harry said nothing, feeling guilty about the false relationship credit he was getting. It was in fact the case that Hermione was modelling him with tremendous accuracy, and that if not for Hermione having a horcrux, the surface of the planet Venus would have dropped to fractional-Kelvin temperatures before Harry tried this. “On a scale of zero to a hundred, how literal a descent into Hell are we talking about here?” said Hermione. The girl now looked a bit worried. Harry mentally calibrated his scales, remembering Azkaban. “I’d say maybe eighty-seven?” “This sounds like something I should do when I’m older, Harry. There’s a difference between being a hero and being a complete lunatic.” Harry shook his head. “I don’t think the risk would change much,” Harry said, leaving aside the question of how much risk that really was, “and it’s the sort of thing that’s better done sooner, if someone does it at all.” “And my parents don’t get a vote,” Hermione said. “Or do they?” Harry shrugged. “We both know how they’d vote, and you can take that into account if you like. Um, I said for Mr and Mrs Granger not to be told yet that you’re alive. They’ll find out after you come back from your mission, if you choose to accept it. That seems a bit…kinder on your par- ents’ nerves, they just get the one pleasant surprise, instead of having to worry about, um, stuff.” “Why, that’s very thoughtful of you,” Hermione said. “It’s nice that you’re so concerned about their feelings. May I think about this for a few minutes, please?” Harry gestured toward the cushion he’d set down opposite his own, and Hermione moved over with fluid grace, and sat down to look out over the castle-edge, still radiating peacefulness all over the place. They’d really need to do something about that, maybe pay someone to invent an Anti- Purity Potion. “Do I have to decide without knowing what the mission is?” Hermione asked. “Oh hell no,” Harry said, thinking of a similar conversation before his own trip to Azkaban. “This is the sort of thing you have to choose freely if you do it at all. I mean that’s an actual mission requirement. If you say that you still want to be a hero, I’ll tell you afterwards about the mission— after you’ve had some time to eat and talk to people and recover a bit— and you’ll decide then if it’s something you want to do. And we’ll test in advance whether returning from death has allowed you to cast the spell that normal wizards think is impossible, before you go out.” Hermione nodded, and fell back into silence. The sky had lightened further by the time Hermione spoke again. “I’m afraid,” Hermione said, almost in a whisper. “Not of dying again, or not just that. I’m afraid I won’t be good enough. I had my chance to defeat a troll, and instead I just died—” “That was a troll empowered by Voldemort as a weapon, plus he sabo- taged all your magic items, just so you know.” “I died. And you killed the troll, somehow, I think I remember that part, it didn’t even slow you down.” Hermione wasn’t crying, no tears glis- tened on her cheeks, she simply gazed off at the lightening sky where the Sun would rise. “And then you brought me back from the dead as a Sparkling Unicorn Princess. I know I couldn’t have done that. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to do that, no matter what people think about me.” “This situation is where your journey begins, I think—” Harry paused. “Excuse me, I shouldn’t be trying to influence your decision.” “No,” Hermione whispered, still gazing at the hills below her. She raised her voice. “No, Harry, I want to hear this.” “Okay. Um. I think this is where you start. Everything that’s happened up until now…it places you in the same place I started out in September, when I’d thought of myself as just being a child prodigy before, and then I found something new I needed to live up to. If you weren’t comparing yourself to me and my,” adult cognitive patterns copied off Tom Riddle, “dark side…then you’d be the brightest star of Ravenclaw, who organized her own company to fight school bullies and kept her sanity under assault by Voldemort, all while she was only twelve years old. I looked it up, you got better grades than Dumbledore did in his first year.” Leaving aside the Defence grade, because that was just Voldemort being Voldemort. “Now you have some powers, and a reputation to live up to, and the world is about to hand you some difficult tasks. That’s where it all begins for you, the same as it began for me. Don’t sell yourself short.” And then Harry shut his mouth hard, because he was talking Hermione into it and that wasn’t right. He’d at least managed to stop before the part where he asked, if she couldn’t be a hero with all that going for her, who exactly she thought was going to do it. “You know,” Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at Harry, “I had a conversation like this with Professor Quirrell, once, about being a hero. He was taking the other side, of course. But apart from that, this is feeling like when he argued with me, somehow.” Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own de- cisions was hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the wrong ones, but it still had to be done. Hermione spoke carefully, the blue fringes of her Hogwarts uniform now seeming brighter against her black robes as the sky all around them became illuminated; there were no more stars in the west. “Professor Quirrell told me, he said he’d been a hero once. But people weren’t helping him enough, so he gave up and went off to do something more interesting. I told Professor Quirrell that it hadn’t been right for him to do that—what I actually said was ‘that’s horrible’. Professor Quirrell said that, yes, maybe he was an awful person, but then what about all the other people who’d never tried to be heroes at all? Were they even worse than him? And I didn’t know what to say back. I mean, it’s wrong to say that only Gryffindor-style heroes are good people—though I think from Professor Quirrell’s perspective it was more like only people with big ambitions had a right to breathe. And I didn’t believe that. But it also seemed wrong to stop being a hero, to walk away like he’d done. So I just stood there looking silly. But now I know what I should’ve told him back then.” Harry controlled his breathing. Hermione stood up from her cushion, and turned to face Harry. “I’m done with trying to be a heroine,” said Hermione Granger with the east- ern sky brightening around her. “I shouldn’t ever have gone along with that entire line of thinking. There are just people who do what they can, whatever they can. And there are also people who don’t even try to do what they can, and yes, those people are doing something wrong. I’m not ever going to try to be a hero again. I’m not going to think in heroic terms if I can help it. But I won’t do any less than I can—or not a lot less, I mean, I’m only human.” Harry had never understood what was supposed to be mys- terious about the Mona Lisa, but if he could have taken a picture of Hermi- one’s resigned/joyous smile just then, he had the sense that he could have looked at it for hours without understanding, and that Dumbledore could have read through it at a glance. “I won’t learn my lesson. I will be that stupid. I’ll go on trying to do most of what I can, or at least some of what I can—oh, you know what I mean. Even if it means risking my life again, so long as it’s worth the risk and isn’t being, you know, actually stupid. That’s my answer.” Hermione took a deep breath, her face resolute. “So, is there something I can do?” Harry’s throat was choked. He reached into his pouch, and signed C- L-O-A-K since he couldn’t speak, and drew forth the fuliginous spill of the Cloak of Invisibility, offering it to Hermione for the last time. Harry had to force the words from his throat. “This is the True Cloak of Invisibility,” Harry said in almost a whisper, “the Deathly Hallow passed down from Ignotus Peverell to his heirs, the Potters. And now to you—” “Harry!” Hermione said. Her hands flew up across her chest, as though to protect herself from the attacking gift. “You don’t have to do this!” “I do have to do this. I’ve left the part of the path that lets me be a hero, I can’t risk myself adventuring, ever. And you…can.” Harry reached up the hand that wasn’t holding the Cloak, and wiped at his eyes. “This was made for you, I think. For the person you’re going to become.” A weapon to fight Death, in its form as the shadow of despair that falls on human minds and drains away their hope for the future; you will fight that, I expect, in more forms than just Dementors… “I do not loan you, my Cloak, but give you, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well for evermore.” Slowly, Hermione reached out, and took hold of the Cloak, looking like she was trying not to cry herself. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I think… even though I’m done with the notion of heroing…I think that you always were, from the day I met you, my mysterious old wizard.” “And I think,” Harry said, his own throat half-closed, “even if you deny that way of thinking now, I think that you were always destined to become, from the very beginning of the story, the hero.” Who must Hermione Gran- ger become, what adult form must she take when she grows up, to pass through Time’s narrow keyhole? I don’t know the answer to that either, any more than I can imagine my own adult self. But her next few steps ahead seem clearer than mine… Harry let the Cloak go, and it passed from his hands to hers. “It sings,” Hermione said. “It’s singing to me.” She reached up, and wiped at her own eyes. “I can’t believe you did that, Harry.” Harry’s other hand came out of his pouch, now bearing a long golden chain, at the end of which dangled a closed golden shell. “And this is your personal time machine.” There was a pause, during which the planet Earth rotated a bit further in its orbit. “What?” said Hermione. “A Time-Turner, they call it. Hogwarts has a stock they give out to some students, I got one at the start of the year to treat my sleep disorder. It lets the user go backwards in time, in up to six one-hour increments, which I used to get six extra hours per day to study. And to vanish out of Potions class and so on. Don’t worry, a Time-Turner can’t change history or generate paradoxes that destroy the universe.” “You were keeping up with me in lessons by studying six extra hours per day using a time machine.” Hermione Granger seemed to be having trouble with this concept for some unaccountable reason. Harry made his face look puzzled. “Is there something odd about that?” Hermione reached out and took the golden necklace. “I guess not by wizard standards,” she said. For some reason her voice sounded rather sharp. She arranged the chain around her neck, placing the hourglass inside her shirt. “I do feel better now about keeping up with you, though, so thank you for that.” Harry cleared his throat. “Also, since Voldemort wiped out the House of Monroe and then, so far as everyone believes, you avenged them by killing Voldemort, I got Amelia Bones to railroad a bill through what’s left of the Wizengamot, saying that Granger is now a Noble House of Britain.” “Excuse me?” said Hermione. “That also makes you the only scion of a Noble House, which means that to get your legal majority you just need to pass your Ordinary Wiz- arding Levels, which I’ve set us up to do at the end of the summer so we’ll have some time to study first. If you’re okay with that, I mean.” Hermione Granger was making some sort of high-pitched noise that would, in a less organic device, have indicated an engine malfunction. “I have two months to study for my O.W.L.s?” “Hermione, it’s a test designed so that most fifteen-year-olds can pass. Ordinary fifteen-year-olds. We can get a passing grade with a low third- year’s power level if we learn the right set of spells, and that’s all we need for our majorities. Though you’ll need to come to terms with getting Ac- ceptable scores instead of your usual Outstandings.” The high-pitched noises coming from Hermione Granger rose in pitch. “Here’s your wand back.” Harry took it from his pouch. “And your mokeskin pouch, I made sure they put back everything that was there when you died.” That pouch Harry withdrew from a normal pocket of his robes, since he was reluctant to put a bag of holding inside a bag of holding no matter what was supposed to be harmless so long as both devices had been crafted observing all safety precautions. Hermione took her wand back, and then her pouch, the motions somehow managing to look graceful even though her fingers were a bit shaky. “Let’s see, what else…the oath you swore before to House Potter only said you had to serve until ‘the day you die’, so you’re now free and clear. And right after your death I got the Malfoys to publicly declare that you were innocent of all charges in Draco’s attempted murder.” “Why, thank you again, Harry,” said Hermione Granger. “That was very nice of you, and them too, I guess.” She was repeatedly running her fingers through her chestnut curls, as though, by organizing her hair, she could restore sanity to her life. “Last but not least, I had the goblins start the process of building a vault in Gringotts for House Granger,” Harry said. “I didn’t put any money into it, because that was something where I could wait and ask you first. But if you’re going to be a superhero who goes around righting certain kinds of wrongs, it will help a lot if people consider you to be part of the upper social strata and, um, I think it may help if they know you can afford lawyers. I can put in as much gold into your vault as you want, since after Voldemort killed Nicholas Flamel, I ended up holding the Philosopher’s Stone.” “I feel like I ought to be fainting,” Hermione said in a high-pitched voice, “only I can’t because of my superpowers and why do I have those again?” “If it’s all right with you, your Occlumency lessons will start on Wednesday with Mr Bester, he can work with you once per day. Until then, I think it might be better for the true origin of your powers not to become known just because a Legilimens looks you in the eyes. I mean, obviously there’s a normal magical explanation, nothing super- supernatural, but people do tend to worship their own ignorance and, well, I think the Girl-Who-Revived will be more effective if you remain mysterious. Once you can keep out Mr Bester and beat Veritaserum, I’ll tell you the entire backstory, I promise, including all the secrets you can never tell anyone else.” “That sounds lovely,” said Hermione Granger. “I’m quite looking for- ward to it.” “Though you’ll need to take an Unbreakable Vow to not do anything that might destroy the world before I can tell you the more dangerous parts of the story. I mean, I literally can’t tell you otherwise, because I took an Unbreakable Vow myself. Is that okay?” “Sure,” said Hermione. “Why shouldn’t it be okay? I wouldn’t want to destroy the world anyhow.” “Do you need to sit down again?” Harry said, feeling alarmed by the way Hermione was swaying slightly, as though in rhythm with the words being spoken. Hermione Granger took several deep breaths. “No, I’m perfectly peachy,” she said. “Is there anything else I should know about?” “That was it. I’m finished, at least for now.” Harry paused. “I do under- stand that you want to do things for yourself, not just have them done for you. It’s just…you’re going to be a more serious kind of hero, and the only sane choice is for me to give you all the advantages I can manage—” “I understand that quite well,” Hermione said. “Now that I’ve actually lost a fight and died. I didn’t used to understand, but now I do.” A breeze ruffled Hermione’s chestnut hair and stirred her robes, making her look even more peaceful in the dawn air, as she raised one hand and carefully clenched it into a fist. “If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it right. We need to measure how hard I can punch, and how high I can jump, and figure out a safe way to test if my fingernails can kill Lethifolds like a real unicorn’s horn, and I should practise using my speed to dodge spells I can’t let hit me and…and it sounds like you could maybe arrange for me to get Auror training, like from whoever taught Susan Bones.” Hermione was smiling again now, a strange light in her eyes that would’ve puzzled Dumbledore for hours and that Harry understood immediately, not with- out a twinge of apprehension. “Oh! And I want to start carrying Muggle weapons, maybe hidden so nobody knows I have them. I thought of incen- diary grenades when I was fighting the troll, but I knew I couldn’t Trans- figure them fast enough, even after I stopped caring about obeying the rules.” “I have the feeling,” Harry said, imitating Professor McGonagall’s Scottish accent as best he could, “that I ought to be doing something about this.” “Oh, it’s much, much, much too late for that, Mr Potter. Say, can you get me a bazooka? The rocket launcher, I mean, not the bubblegum? I bet they won’t be expecting that from a young girl, especially if I’m radiating an aura of innocence and purity.” “All right,” Harry said calmly, “now you’re starting to scare me.” Hermione paused from where she was experimenting with balancing on the tip of her left shoe, her arm reaching in one direction and her right leg stretched in the other, like a ballet dancer. “Am I? I was just thinking that I didn’t see what I could do that a Ministry squad of Hit Wizards couldn’t. They have broomsticks for mobility and spells that hit harder than I possibly could.” She gracefully lowered her leg back down. “I mean, now that I can try a few things without worrying about who’s watching, I’m starting to think that I really really really like having superpowers. But I still don’t see how I could win a fight that Professor Flitwick couldn’t, not unless it involves me taking a Dark Wizard by surprise.” You can take risks other people shouldn’t, and try again with the knowledge of what killed you. You can experiment with new spells, more than anyone else could try without dying for sure. But Harry couldn’t say any of that yet, so instead he said, “I think it’s okay to think more about the future, not just what you can do this very minute.” Hermione jumped high in the air, clicked her heels together three times on the way down, and landed on her tiptoes, perfectly posed. “But you said there was something I could do right away. Or were you just testing?” “That part is a special case,” Harry said, feeling the chill of the dawn air against his skin. He was increasingly not looking forward to telling super-Hermione that her Ordeal would involve facing her literal worst nightmare, under conditions where all her newfound physical strength would be useless. Hermione nodded, then glanced to the east. At once she went to the side of the roof and sat down, her feet dangling over the rooftop ledge. Harry went to her side and sat down too, sitting cross-legged and further back of the roof-edge. In the distance, a brilliant tinge of red was rising above the hills to the east of Hogwarts. Watching the tip of the sunrise made Harry feel better, somehow. So long as the Sun was in the sky, things were still all right on some level, like his having not yet destroyed the Sun. “So,” Hermione said. Her voice rose a bit. “Speaking of the future, Harry. I had time to think about a lot of things while I was waiting in St. Mungo’s, and…maybe it’s silly of me, but there’s a question I still want to know the answer to. Do you remember the last thing we talked about together? Before, I mean?” “What?” Harry said blankly. “Oh…” Hermione said. “It was two months ago for you…I guess you don’t recall, then.” And Harry remembered. “Don’t panic!” Hermione said, as a sort of strangled half-gurgle came from Harry’s throat. “I promise no matter what you say, I won’t burst into tears and run away and get eaten by a troll again! I know it’s been less than two days for me, but I think that dying has made a lot of things I used to fret about seem much less important compared to what I’ve been through!” “Oh,” Harry said, his own voice now high-pitched. “That’s a good use of a major trauma, I guess?” “Only, see, I was still wondering about it, Harry, because for me it hasn’t been very long at all since our last conversation, and we didn’t fin- ish talking which was admittedly all my own fault for losing control of my emotions and then being eaten by a troll which I am definitely not going to do again. I’ve been thinking I ought to reassure you that’s not going to happen every time you say the wrong thing to a girl.” Hermione was fidgeting, leaning from one side to the other where she sat, slightly back and forth. “But, well, even most people who are in love don’t do literally one hundredth of what you’ve done for me. So, Mr Harry James Potter- Evans-Verres, if it’s not love, I want to know exactly what I am to you. You never said.” “That’s a good question,” Harry said, controlling the rising panic. “Do you mind if I think about it?” Bit by bit, more of the searingly brilliant circle became visible beyond the hills. “Hermione,” Harry said when the Sun was halfway above the horizon, “did you ever invent any hypotheses to explain my mysterious dark side?” “Just the obvious one,” Hermione said, kicking her legs slightly over the rooftop’s edge. “I thought maybe when You-Know-Who died right next to you, he happened to give off the burst of magic that makes a ghost, and some of it imprinted on your brain instead of the floor. But that never felt right to me, like it was just a clever explanation that wasn’t actually true, and it makes even less sense if You-Know-Who didn’t really die that night.” “Good enough,” Harry said. “Let’s imagine that scenario for now.” His inner rationalist was looking back and face-palming again at how he’d managed to not think about hypotheses like that one. It wasn’t true but it was reasonable and Harry had never thought of any causal model that concrete, just vaguely suspected a connection. Hermione nodded. “You probably know this already, but I just thought I’d say it to be sure: you’re not Voldemort, Harry.” “I know. And that’s what you mean to me.” Harry took a breath, find- ing it still painful to say aloud. “Voldemort…he wasn’t a happy person. I don’t know if he was ever happy, a single day in his life.” He never could cast the Patronus Charm. “That’s one reason his cognitive patterns didn’t take me over, my dark side didn’t feel like a good place to be, it didn’t get posi- tively reinforced. Being friends with you means that my life doesn’t have to go the way Voldemort’s did. And I was pretty lonely before Hogwarts, although I didn’t realise it then, so…yeah. I might’ve been slightly more desperate to bring you back from the dead than the average boy my age would’ve been. Though I also maintain that my decision was strictly nor- mative moral reasoning, and if other people care less about their friends, that’s their problem, not mine.” “I see,” Hermione said softly. She hesitated. “Harry, don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m not one hundred percent comfortable with that. It’s a big responsibility that I didn’t choose, and I don’t think it’s healthy for you to lay it on just one person.” Harry nodded. “I know. But there’s more to the point I’m trying to make. There was a prophecy about my vanquishing Voldemort—” “A prophecy? There was a prophecy about you? Seriously, Harry?” “Yeah, I know. Anyway, part of it went, ‘And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal, but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.’ What would you guess that meant?” “Hmmm,” Hermione said. Her fingers tapped thoughtfully on the roof’s stone. “Your mysterious dark side is You-Know-Who’s mark on you that made you his equal. The power he knew not…was the scientific method, right?” Harry shook his head. “That’s what I thought too at first—that it was going to be Muggle science, or the methods of rationality. But…” Harry ex- haled. The sun had now fully risen above the hills. This felt embarrassing to say, but he was going to say it anyway. “Professor Snape, who originally heard the prophecy—yes, that’s also a thing that happened—Professor Snape said he didn’t think it could just be science, that the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ needed to be something more alien to Voldemort than just that. Even if I think of it in terms of rationality, well, it turns out that the person Voldemort really was,” why, Professor Quirrell, why, the thought still stabbing sickness at Harry’s heart, “he’d have been able to learn the methods of rationality too, if he read the same science papers I did. Except, maybe, for one last thing…” Harry drew a breath. “At the end of all of it, during my final showdown with Voldemort, he threatened to put my parents, and my friends, into Azkaban. Unless I came up with interesting secrets to tell him, one person saved per secret. But I knew I couldn’t find enough secrets to save everyone. And in the moment that I saw no way at all left to save everyone…that’s when I actually started thinking. Maybe for the first time in my life, I started thinking. I thought faster than Voldemort, even though he was older than me and smarter, because…because I had a reason to think. Voldemort had a drive to be im- mortal, he strongly preferred not to die, but that wasn’t a positive desire, it was fear, and Voldemort made mistakes because of that fear. I think the power that Voldemort knew not…was that I had something to protect.” “Oh, Harry,” Hermione said gently. She hesitated. “Is that what I am to you, then? The thing that you protect?” “No, I mean, the whole reason I’m telling you this, is that Voldemort wasn’t threatening to put you in Azkaban. Even if he’d taken over the whole world, you’d have been fine. He’d already made a binding promise not to harm you, because of, um, because of reasons. So in my mo- ment of ultimate crisis, when I reached deep down and found the power Voldemort knew not, I did it to protect everyone except you.” Hermione considered this, a slow smile spreading over her face. “Why, Harry,” she said. “That’s the least romantic thing I’ve ever heard.” “You’re welcome.” “No, really, it does help,” Hermione said. “I mean, it makes the whole thing much less stalkery.” “I know, right?” The two of them shared a companionable nod, both of them looking more relaxed now, and watched the sunrise together. “I’ve been thinking,” Harry said, his own voice going soft, “about the alternate Harry Potter, the person I might have been if Voldemort hadn’t attacked my parents.” If Tom Riddle hadn’t tried to copy himself onto me. “That other Harry Potter wouldn’t have been as smart, I guess. He probably wouldn’t have studied much Muggle science, even if his mother was a Muggle-born. But that other Harry Potter would’ve had…the capacity for warmth, that he inherited from James Potter and Lily Evans, he would’ve cared about other people and tried to save his friends, I know that would have been true, because that’s something that Lord Voldemort never did, you see…” Harry’s eyes were watering. “So that part must be the remnant.” The Sun was well above the horizon now, the golden light illuminat- ing both of them, casting long shadows off the other side of the rooftop platform. “I think you’re just fine the way you are,” Hermione said. “I mean, that other Harry Potter might’ve been a nice boy, maybe, but it sounds like I would’ve had to do all his thinking for him.” “Going by heredity, alter-Harry would have been in Gryffindor like his parents, and the two of you wouldn’t have become friends. Though James Potter and Lily Evans were the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts back in their day, so he wouldn’t have been that bad.” “I can just imagine it,” Hermione said. “Harry James Potter, Sorted into Gryffindor, aspiring Quidditch player—” “No. Just no.” “Remembered by history as the sidekick of Hermione Jean Granger, who’d send out Mr Potter to get into trouble for her, and then solve the mystery from the library by reading books and using her incredible mem- ory.” “You’re really enjoying this alternate universe, aren’t you.” “Maybe he’d be best mates with Ron Weasley, the smartest boy in Gryf- findor, and they’d fight side-by-side in my army in Defence class, and afterwards help each other with their homework—” “Okay, enough, this is starting to creep me out.” “Sorry,” Hermione said, though she was still smiling to herself, ap- pearing rapt in some private vision. “Apology accepted,” Harry said dryly. The Sun rose a little further in the sky. After a while, Hermione spoke. “Do you suppose we’ll fall in love with each other later on?” “I don’t know any better than you do, Hermione. But why does it have to be about that? Seriously, why does it always have to be about that? Maybe when we’re older we’ll fall in love, and maybe we won’t. Maybe we’ll stay in love, and maybe we won’t.” Harry turned his head slightly, the Sun was hot on his cheek and he wasn’t wearing sunscreen. “No matter how it goes, we shouldn’t try to force our lives into a pattern. I think when people try to force patterns onto this sort of thing, that’s when they end up unhappy.” “No forced patterns?” Hermione said. Her eyes had taken on a mis- chievous look. “That sounds like a more complicated way of saying no rules. Which I guess seems a lot more reasonable to me than it would’ve at the start of this year. If I’m going to be a Sparkling Unicorn Princess and have my own time machine, I might as well give up on rules, I suppose.” “I’m not saying that rules are always bad, especially when they actu- ally fit people, instead of them being blindly imitated like Quidditch. But weren’t you the one who rejected the ‘hero’ pattern in favour of just doing the things she could?” “I suppose so.” Hermione turned her head again to gaze down at the grounds below Hogwarts, for the Sun was too bright to look at now— though, Harry thought, Hermione’s retinas would always heal now, it was safe for her alone to look directly into the light. “You said, Harry, that you thought I was always destined to be the hero. I’ve been considering, and I suspect you’re completely wrong. If this had been meant to be, things would’ve been a lot easier all round. Just doing the things you can do— you have to make that happen, you have to choose it, over and over again.” “That might not conflict with your being a destined hero,” Harry said, thinking of compatibilist theories of free will, and prophecies that he must not look upon in order to fulfil. “But we can talk about that later.” “You have to choose it,” Hermione repeated. She pushed herself up on her hands, then popped herself backwards and onto the rooftop, rising to her feet in a smooth motion. “Just like I’m choosing to do this.” “No kissing!” Harry said, scrambling to his feet and preparing to dodge; though the realization came to him that the Girl-Who-Revived would be much, much faster. “I won’t try to kiss you again, Mr Potter. Not until you ask me, if you ever do. But there are all these warm feelings bubbling up inside me and I feel like I might burst if I don’t do something, though it does now occur to me that it’s unhealthy if girls don’t know any way of expressing gratitude to boys besides kissing them.” Hermione took out her wand and offered it crosswise, in the position she’d used to swear her oath of fealty to House Potter before the Wizengamot. “Oh hell no,” Harry said. “Do you realise what it took to get you out of that oath last time—” “Don’t go jumping to conclusions, you. I wasn’t about to swear fealty to your House again. You’ve got to start trusting me to be sensible if you’re going to be my mysterious young wizard. Now please hold out your wand.” Slowly, Harry took out the Elder Wand and crossed it with Hermione’s ten-and-three-quarter-inches of vine wood, forcing down a last worry about her choosing the wrong thing. “Can you at least not say anything about ‘until death takes me’, because did I mention I have the Philoso- pher’s Stone now? Or anything about ‘the end of the world and its magic’? I’m a lot more nervous around phrases like that than I used to be.” 1945 CH APTER 12 2 1946 SOMETHING TO PROTECT: HERMIONE GRANG ER 1947 1949 APPE NDIX A Draco went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of relief. It had seemed like a sure thing, but you never did know what tiny event might upset the course of your master plan. They were approaching the P’s now… And over at the Gryffindor table, there was a whispered conversation. “What if he doesn’t like it?” “He’s got no right to not like it—” “—not after the prank he played on—” “—Neville Longbottom, his name was—” “—he’s as fair a fair target now as fair can be.” “All right. Just make sure you don’t forget your parts.” “We’ve rehearsed it often enough—” “—over the last three hours.” And Minerva McGonagall, from where she stood at the speaker’s podium of the Head Table, looked down at the next name on her list. Please don’t let him be a Gryffindor please don’t let him be a Gryffindor oh please don’t let him be a Gryffindor… She took a deep breath, and called: “Potter, Harry!” There was a sudden silence in the hall as all whispered conversation stopped. A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated and changed in hideous mockery of musical melody. Minerva’s head jerked around, shocked, and identified the buzzing noise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They were standing on top of the table blowing into some kind of tiny devices held against Their lips. Her hand started to drop to her wand, to Silencio the lot of Them, but another sound stopped her. Dumbledore was chuckling. Minerva’s eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just started to step out of line before he’d stumbled and halted. Then the young boy began to walk again, moving his legs in odd sweep- ing motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snapping his fin- gers, in synchrony with Their music. To the tune of “Ghostbusters” (As performed on the kazoo by Fred and George Weasley, and sung by Lee Jordan.) . There’s a Dark Lord near? Got no need to fear Who you gonna call? “Harry Potter!” shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins per- formed a triumphant chorus. With a Killing Curse? Well it could be worse. Who you gonna call? “Harry Potter!” There were a lot more voices shouting it this time. The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now accom- panied by some of the older Muggle-borns, who had produced their own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware no doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter shouted: I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords! There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table, and instruments. The more students produced their own anti-musical hideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful crescendo: I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords! Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look but with all too good a notion of what she would see. Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with cu- riosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking severe, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement. Directly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her right, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the thick silver was slowly deforming. Dark robes and a mask? Impossible task? Who you gonna call? Harry Potter! Giant Fire-Ape? Old bat in a cape? Who you gonna call? Harry Potter! Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with Them about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to take away. If They didn’t care about detentions then she would find something else. Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape’s direction, surely he realised the Potter boy must have no idea who that was talking about— Snape’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indiffer- ence. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet… And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through the motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face. It was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The least he could do was play along and not ruin it all. Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and sort of awful at the same time. They were cheering him for a job he’d done when he was one year old. A job he hadn’t really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew that? But the Dark Lord’s power had been broken once. And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darn prophecy said. All those people believing in him and cheering him—Harry couldn’t stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child prodi- gies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation as a sym- bol of the Light, never mind how he’d won it. He would absolutely, pos- itively, no matter how long it took and even if it killed him, fulfil their expectations. And then go on to exceed those expectations, so that people wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of him. And he shouted out the lie that he’d invented because it scanned well and the song called for it: I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords! I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords! Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music ended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die away… Omake Files III: Alternate Endings of ‘Self-Awareness’ The offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what “has never happened before” spurred a lot of interesting attempts. The first omake below is taken directly from my personal favourite answer, by Meteoric- shipyards. The second is based on Kazuma’s suggestion for what “has never happened before”, the third on a combination of yoyoente and dou- gal74, the fourth on wolf550e’s review of chapter 10. The one that starts with ‘K’, and the one just above that, are from DarkHeart81. The others are my own. Anyone who wants to pick up one of my own ideas and run with them, particularly the last one, is welcome to do so. And before I get 100 indignant complaints, yes, I am well aware that the legislative body of the UK is the House of Commons in Parliament. “Oh, dear. This has never happened before…” What? “I’m allergic to your hair shampoo—” And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty “A-CHOO!” that echoed around the Great Hall. “Well!” Dumbledore cried jovially. “It seems Harry Potter has been sorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve as the Head of House Achoo. You’d better hurry up on making arrangements for Achoo’s curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the first day!” “But, but, but,” stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly complete disarray, “who will be Head of House Gryffindor?” It was all she could think of, she had to stop this somehow… Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful. “Snape.” Snape’s screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall’s, “Then who will be Head of Slytherin?” “Hagrid.” 1955 APPE NDIX A “SLYTHERIN!” Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter’s face, Fred Weasley thought faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he whipped out his wand, whispered “Silencio!” and then “Changemyvoiceio!” and finally “Ven- triliquo!” “Just kidding!” said Fred Weasley. “GRYFFINDOR!” “Oh, dear. This has never happened before…” What? “I’ve had to tell students before that they were mothers—it would break your heart to know what I saw in their minds—but this is the first time I’ve ever had to tell someone they were a father.” What? “Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby.” Whaaaaaaat? “To repeat: Draco Malfoy is carrying your baby.” But we’re only eleven— “Actually, Draco is secretly thirteen years old.” B-b-but men can’t get pregnant— “And a girl under those clothes.” But we’ve never had sex, you idiot! “She Obliviated you after the rape, moron!” Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell off the stool with a dull thud. “RAVENCLAW!” called out the Hat from where it lay on top of his head. That had been even funnier than its first idea. “Oh, dear. This has never happened before…” What? “I’ve never Sorted someone who was a reincarnation of Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin and Naruto.” 1957 APPE NDIX A “Fooled you again! HUFFLEPUFF!
